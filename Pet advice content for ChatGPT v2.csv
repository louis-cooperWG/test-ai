Fireworks: how to keep your pets safe," Spotting fear and anxiety in your pets
All pets show different signs of fear. A dog might pant, pace, or shake in fear, while a cat may freeze, hide, or withdraw from affection. Here are a couple of examples and what you can do to help your pet:

&nbsp;
Dogs
Signs of stress:

 	Appearing restless and unsettled
 	Seeking reassurance when they would typically be resting
 	Panting and pacing
 	Looking for somewhere to hide
 	Shaking
 	Unable to concentrate when doing something they enjoy

Preparing your dog for fireworks:
The weeks leading up to Fireworks Night is the best time to begin your training. If your dog is young, they may not have seen or heard fireworks before, so it’s good to introduce some training to teach them that noises aren't scary.

 	Download firework sounds and play them on a low volume while your dog is doing something they enjoy, like eating dinner or playing with their toys
 	Vary the sound recording and providing your dog is relaxed, increase the volume over a few sessions
 	Remember to secure your garden and check your dog's microchip in case they get scared and wander off somewhere
 	It's also a good idea to keep your dog on the lead and make sure they are wearing a securely fitting harness if you're going for a walk after dark

How to manage a frightened dog:

 	Have a place for your dog to hide
 	If your dog comes out to you, praise them for being brave
 	If your dog comes to you for reassurance, keep your voice calm. It's OK to be affectionate and soothe them
 	Make sure your dog is tired from a good walk and meal
 	Close the curtains and put the radio or TV on for background noise
 	Give your dog a special treat or favourite chew to keep them busy
 	If your dog is displaying mild anxiety, distract them with a play or training session
 	Get a supplement to help your dog:
ADAPTIL plug-ins or collars are best if used 2 weeks before the night. ”DAP” (Adaptil) is short for Dog Appeasing Pheromones.
YuCalm L-Theanine offers natural calming properties that support the production of calming compounds such as serotonin.
Anaxitane Chewable Tablets help pets keep calm and relaxed. They contain a pure synthetic form of L-Theanine, an amino acid naturally found in green tea leaves.
Calmex is a calming supplement that helps maintain a normal disposition

Signs of stress:

 	Enlarged pupils
 	Arched back
 	Crouching gait, low carriage of the tail and slow low movement
 	Hair standing on end
 	Hissing or low grumbling
 	Hiding
 	Trying to appear smaller
 	Withdrawing from your affection
 	Ears back and ‘freezing’
 	Appearing more alert and running away from sounds or familiar people
 	Lack of appetite or an upset stomach
 	Change in personality, seeing aggressive type behaviours towards people or other pets that are unusual for your cat

How to manage a frightened cat:

 	If your cat has access to an outdoor space, keep them in when it gets dark
 	For cats living outdoors, such as farm or stable cats, make sure they have spacious shelter. Shutting them in may cause more stress
 	Close your curtains to shut out any light flashes
 	Play music or put the television on to help mask the sound of fireworks
 	Give your cat plenty of personal space. Allow them to hide if they wish and come out in their own time. Trying to comfort them or pulling them from their hiding place may cause more stress
 	If they choose to stay in the same room as you, gently talk to them for reassurance. They may find a familiar voice soothing at this time
 	Provide your cat with tasty food or treats. Although their appetite may be low, some cats will like to have a positive treat to help distract them from the noises
 	Make sure your cat has lots of hiding places around the house. That way they'll have a choice of safe places to retreat to
 	Provide an indoor litter tray in a quiet location, close to places your cat can hide. Bear in mind, anxious cats often avoid toilet visits if they feel threatened
 	Use products such as Feliway or Pet Remedy to help reduce stress. It's best to start using them a few weeks before fireworks are expected
 	If your cat becomes extremely anxious, speak to your vet

&nbsp; Small pets - How to spot fear in small pets

Frightened rabbits:

 	Stamp their back feet repeatedly, this can continue for several minutes and often occurs after unexpected noises or movements within their environment
 	Hide in a corner
 	Have wide eyes
 	Breathe rapidly
 	Kick and bite when picked up
 	‘Freeze’
 	In some cases, a bonded pair of rabbits may have a fight

Frightened guinea pigs:

 	Dart around
 	Have wide eyes
 	Stiffen their body
 	Breathe rapidly
 	Hide in a corner
 	‘Freeze’
 	Dig at the floor trying to cover themselves

Frightened ferrets:

 	Release their scent glands
 	Dart quickly undercover
 	Hiss
 	Shake their tail with body trembling
 	Aggressively bite when picked up

Frightened rodents:

 	Hiss
 	Squeal when picked up
 	Hide in small spaces
 	‘Freeze’
 	Move to bite you when your hand enters the accommodation

How to manage frightened small pets
It may be tempting to move your small outdoor pets like rabbits, guinea pigs and ferrets inside when firework displays are on.

Some may benefit the move into a shed or garage overnight to protect them from the sights and sounds. However, some small pets find it distressing. Moving your small pets from their familiar environment can be quite stressful, so it may be better to leave them in their normal space. We recommend the following to help them with firework season:

 	Add extra hiding spaces and bedding to their accommodation
 	Lock away outdoor pets in their night accommodation slightly earlier than normal to allow them to settle before the fireworks start
 	Partially cover hutches and enclosures with thick blankets. This will help muffle the sound of fireworks, whilst also providing enough ventilation
 	For small pets living indoors, close the curtains and put a radio on for some background noise
 	Provide them with their favourite healthy treats to encourage foraging which will help them focus. This could include hay kebabs, paper rummage bags, stuffed toilet rolls, feed balls and activity treat boards
 	Avoid too much handling as this can cause more fear and stress
 	Companionship is the biggest protector against fear for most small pets (other than hamsters). A pair or group of the same species are far more likely to remain in a relaxed state as their companions offer security and comfort.

&nbsp;
Outdoor animals
Signs of stress:

 	Showing the whites of their eyes
 	Rolling of eyes
 	Stomping feet
 	Displaying any unnatural behaviour
 	Running with the herd

&nbsp;
How to manage field animals and fireworks

 	Speak to your neighbours to find out when and where fireworks displays are being held so that you can prepare
 	Keep to a normal routine, but if possible make sure your animal has been fed an hour before a display starts
 	All animals need company, whether they’re stabled or turned out
 	If you keep your animal in a stable, keep a light and radio on with soothing music to help block out the noise
 	If your animals stay in their field overnight, check the fencing to make sure it's secure
 	Shut all poultry away so they can roost safely
 	Check the fields before you turn out the following morning for any remains of fireworks
 	If your animal becomes extremely anxious, speak to your vet

What to feed your mice,"When it comes to looking after your pet mice, you must take into consideration their diet. Feeding them the right foods will ensure they live happy and healthy lives. Here we look at the different types of diet, what to feed them and healthy treats.
What is the diet of a mouse? 
A good quality, complete dry mixture that provides essential nutrients should form the basis of your mouse’s diet.

There are limited good quality diets available for mice – so you may want to choose a good rat or gerbil mix instead. Whatever you choose, make sure it has a good mixture of grains, seeds, pulses and a meat source such as dried meal worms, or kibble.
Help your mouse forage for food
Mice are foragers and will spend hours digging through the bedding and searching their environment looking for food. To avoid your mice becoming obese and bored, scatter their daily allowance around the enclosure rather than feeding in a bowl.

Add a variety of treats to their weekly diet to keep it interesting and to provide all the essential vitamins and minerals your mouse requires.
Healthy treats for mice (to be fed in small amounts):

 	Pasta, cooked or raw
 	A variety of fruits and vegetables including broccoli, curly kale, strawberries and grapes
 	Small amount of boiled eggs
 	Pulses and cereals
 	Fresh mealworms – one or two at a time, unless your dry food already has these included
 	Apple wood – or other fruit tree wood – to gnaw on
 	Dried herbs. There are many mixtures available from pet stores such as mountain and garden mix
 	Dog biscuits such as gravy bones
 	Millet seed spray for birds

Water supplements, fatty or colourful chew sticks and mineral and salt blocks are unnecessary and can in some cases be harmful. Avoid these and stick to healthy, natural treats and food options.
Can mice eat grapes?
Contrary to popular belief, grapes are safe to feed to your pet mice. There’s plenty of research behind the health benefits of grapes for mice. They may be small, but they pack a punch of anti-oxidants.

Grapes, melon and cucumber are refreshing treats, great for if you’re travelling with your mice. Unlike a water bottle which can spill and leak, juicy fruits and vegetables are a mess-free way to keep mice hydrated.

Make your hamster feel at home,"Although they are small creatures, hamsters have bags of energy – particularly Syrian and Roborovski hamsters. They’re very busy and will spend hours foraging for food and creating new territories and hides. They need a much more interesting home than a small cage with a house and wheel.

Creating the right home for your hamster
The cage you choose will need to enable you to add lots of activities for them to climb and explore, a floor space that they can do lots of running around on and bedding that they can dig and forage in.

Syrian hamsters
Syrian hamsters should be housed in a large, mesh cage. They like to climb and roam around large areas, so the cage should have several levels and a large enough floor space to keep them active.
The minimum cage size for a Syrian hamster:


 	Depth: 50cm
 	Width: 80cm
 	Height: 50cm
 	Bar spacing: 1cm is the safest size

Dwarf breeds
The dwarf breeds (Winter White, Campbell, Roborovski and Chinese) can all be housed in a similar style of cage. These hamsters need plenty of floor space to explore to keep them mentally and physically stimulated.
Roborovski and Russian hamsters are poor climbers due to being very lightweight and having little muscle tone, so they are best housed without high levels or tunnels placed at challenging angles. Large glass or plastic aquariums with well-ventilated lids are most suitable for these breeds. Chinese hamsters are a little more agile but still prefer longer rather than taller cages.
For all these breeds, make sure your chosen cage has minimum bar spacing as they can easily escape through seemingly smalls gaps. The minimum cage size for a single or pair of dwarf hamsters:


 	Depth: 50cm
 	Width: 80cm
 	Height: 35cm
 	Bar spacing: 6mm is the safest size
 Keep your hamsters happy and occupied
Hamsters are known for sleeping lots – but when they’re awake, they want to be busy exploring, foraging and digging. Many owners find their hamster will chew the bars or even try to escape – this is often a clear indication they’re bored and their environment is either not big or interesting enough.
Make sure you provide your hamster with toys and activities to keep them fit, healthy and happy. It doesn’t need to be expensive. Homemade items, children’s toys and even a kitchen roll tube will be much appreciated by your little pet.

Your hamster will enjoy:

 	Plastic or card tunnels and tubes. Some tunnels allow you to build big mazes with them. If you have a tiny Roborovski, take care not to make them too challenging
 	Card boxes such as shoe and cereal boxes
 	Children’s toys, such as mini dollhouses and early learning toys, can offer great hiding places and nesting opportunities
 	Wheels provide your hamster with the opportunity to really feel like they are getting the natural amount of walking and running they would do in the wild. Ensure that you choose a wheel that suits the hamsters size so they are not squashed and able to fully stretch out. Ensure it also is a solid plastic wheel and not a mesh wheel. Wheels do not need to be in the cage all the time. We recommend changing all enrichment or its location weekly to mimic the change in surroundings they would have in the wild.
 	Ropes and ladders. These are most suited to Syrian hamsters
 	Plastic houses and hides
 	Hammocks – more suited to Syrian hamsters
 	Shallow litter trays or plastic take away tubs filled with hamster sand for them to dig.

Choosing the right hamster bedding
The wrong bedding for your hamster can have a very negative effect on their health. Wood shavings or sawdust can be extremely harmful to your hamster’s skin and airway, and can give you an allergic reaction too!
Below are bedding materials that are safe for your hamster to snuggle in:


 	Small-cut, shredded paper. Easy to use, and best of all, it’s free! Use shredded paper to line the floor
 	Finacard. A shredded card material, good for the base of the cage
 	Cardboard squares around 1 cm square, ideal for the base of the cage
 	White, soft tissue paper bedding is suitable for hamster bedding. Please avoid the cotton wool type, as this can be dangerous to your hamster

How to clean out your hamster
Keeping your hamster cage clean is key to preventing serious health conditions such as wet tail and respiratory problems.
If your hamster has chosen a toilet area, clean this corner daily and top up with fresh bedding to reduce the smell.
Carry out a full clean of the entire enclosure once a week, ensuring you also clean all toys and activities with pet-friendly disinfectant. Take the opportunity to add a few new toys in the cage for interest, like a new box for your hamster to explore.         "
Rehoming dogs from abroad,"Many dogs from abroad are imported into the UK for rehoming. They often come from Eastern-European countries, or even as far as India and Africa. The number of imported dogs has increased significantly over the last 12 months.

What to think about before getting a dog
Taking on a dog is a long-term commitment, so it's important to make the right decision before progressing to the next stage of ownership. First, you need to consider whether you’ll be able to fulfil their needs, dogs need plenty of exercise, training, mental stimulation and companionship.
Think about how a dog will fit into your lifestyle, do you work full time? If so, you’ll need your dog to feel comfortable when left at home alone. Will a new dog get on with any other pets you have? Consider the attributes you need in a dog, for example, whether they need to be good around children or able to travel happily in a car with you. Finding a dog that best suits your lifestyle is a pleasure to own. Here are a few more suggestions of things you should think about before owning a dog.
What should you consider before rehoming an imported dog

The cost
Sometimes the cost of a puppy bred in the UK leads to a wider search and although imported puppies could seem more cost-effective, in reality this is often not the case. Most individuals wouldn’t travel abroad to see a puppy in the breeder’s home, even though this is an essential step when getting a new puppy.

Vaccinations
All puppies imported from abroad will need to have had their rabies vaccinations, however the required timing of this significantly delays puppies when they’re transferring to their new homes, this means they often miss their important habituation and socialisation period. Missing these key experiences can have a damaging long-term impact on a puppy.

Information
In the UK, it can be challenging to find rescue dogs of a particular type you are seeking. British rehoming charities will provide you with genuine information on a dog’s background and needs. Having this information will help you make an informed decision on how and if you should proceed with the rehoming. A good match means you will want to keep the dog and won’t need to return it to the charity.

A new environment
Dogs who come from abroad are not always used to living in a family home. In many countries, dogs often live outside in rural locations. By rehoming a dog from abroad who is used to a different environment means they might find it harder to adapt to a new domestic lifestyle. Imported dogs often feel anxious in the home and become frightened of appliances, visitors and other strange noises. Seeing your dog looking scared and anxious is distressing for you as an owner and you might want to comfort them.
Try to remember that a dog from abroad won’t have experienced general handling and affection from their owner and might not like it. In some cases, this can lead to the dog becoming defensive by growling, snapping, or biting to avoid the contact they don’t like. Dogs who have never lived inside before often need time to adjust to their new environment, and during this time owners need to be accepting of some challenging behaviours. Risk of disease
UK vets are seeing an increase in the number of diseases in dogs rescued from abroad that are not common in this country. Some of these diseases can have potential health effects on the dog as well as the risk of passing it on to other dogs and potentially humans. Dogs can often be infected before displaying symptoms, this is when there’s a greater risk of the infection spreading to others through biting insects and ticks. Many responsible rehoming charities will screen dogs from abroad for diseases before their arrival into the UK.
Some of these dogs can arrive with signs of disease, other health conditions and injuries, including fractured bones that haven’t healed well. Veterinary care can vary considerably between countries as well as different techniques, for example, chemical castrations which might not provide permanent results.

Some diseases of imported dogs include:
Rabies: All dogs entering the UK must be vaccinated against rabies at least 3 weeks before entry and they must hold a valid passport. The British Veterinary Association prefer a 12 week wait post vaccination to reduce the risk to puppies being transported entering UK.
Leishmania: A severe disease caused by the Leishmania parasite transmitted to dogs, other mammals and sometimes humans through bites of the sandfly which is not found in the UK. Dogs who come from Southern and Eastern European countries are at greater risk of infection, which causes skin lesions and severe illness including depression, weight loss and severe kidney failure.
Brucellosis: A bacterial infection that causes diseases of the reproductive system and painful vertebral disc disease in dogs. It is widespread in many parts of mainland Europe including Romania. It is especially common in large stray dog populations and isolated cases have now been reported in the UK.
Heartworm (Dirofilaria): A parasite spread by mosquitoes across the Southern Mediterranean. It can cause worms to grow and live inside the heart. It can take months for a dog to show signs after being infected.

Ticks
Another thing to consider before rehoming a dog from abroad is the variety of ticks that might be common in other countries, but not the UK. Some ticks are able to transmit infectious diseases to dogs, including Babesiosis and Ehrlichiosis, carried by the brown dog tick.
Babesiosis causes fatigue, pale gums and dark urine which can also infect humans. Signs of Ehrlichiosis include a mild fever, weight loss and bleeding.

Meeting the dog you’re interested in
Many charities will carefully rescue dogs from abroad and place them in UK foster homes before they’re rehomed. This gives the opportunity for dogs to adapt in the UK as a domesticated pet. It also gives the rescue charity time to assess the dog’s needs, likes, and dislikes. If you’re considering rehoming a dog from abroad from a charity, only consider those who will take the dog back if the match doesn’t work out.
Don’t underestimate the importance of meeting a dog before you agree to rehome them, it’s such a big commitment. A picture, description, or video isn’t enough for you to decide whether the dog’s personality will fit in with your family. It might also miss out some of the important points you need to know before rehoming. For example, in a meet, you will get a better understanding of how well trained the dog is, how they handle being on and off-lead, their reaction to unfamiliar people and interaction with other dogs.

Testing the waters
Some charities will allow you to look after the dog in your home as a trial period before the rehoming becomes official, this works as a type of fostering. This arrangement will allow you to get to know the dog while following the charity’s advice to help them settle in. In a situation where you find out the dog isn’t quite right for your family, the charity can try to help you work things out, or they can take the dog back if there’s something wrong. If the charity doesn’t specifically mention this service, it’s worth enquiring about to see if they can come to an arrangement with you. This will show they’re invested to help you.         "
How to spot if your dog has blocked anal glands,"It’s not a particularly nice subject to talk about, but it’s important to keep an eye on your dog and know what the symptoms are of blocked anal glands. Blocked anal glands can cause a lot of discomfort for your dog, not to mention a costly fee for you. This article will help you spot the symptoms of blocked anal glands, what the treatment involves and how to stop it happening again.
How can you tell if your dog’s anal glands are full?
If a dog hasn’t emptied their bowel properly or after a few days of passing soft stools, their anal glands tend to fill up. The pressure of firm stools helps release liquid from the glands. So, a sure-fire way of telling if your dog’s anal glands are full is by checking their poo. There are also certain signs and symptoms to look out for alongside this. What are the symptoms of blocked anal glands?

Blocked anal glands are very uncomfortable and unpleasant for dogs. Ever seen your dog dragging or scooting their bottoms along the ground? It’s one of the most common signs that your dog may have blocked anal glands and you should arrange to see your local vet.

Here are some other symptoms to look out for:

 	Licking or biting around their anal area
 	Chasing their tail
 	Sitting uncomfortably
 	Foul smelling ‘fishy’ odour

How are blocked anal glands treated?
A vet or vet nurse treats this by squeezing the anal glands to release the liquid. As much as you want to relieve the pain for your canine companion, it’s important this is done by a qualified person. You could cause more pain or an injury if you try to do it yourself.
How do I avoid the problem reoccurring?
Your dog may require regular treatment if it keeps happening. And if their anal glands become infected, they may need a course of antibiotics.

Severe cases may require anal gland infusion, flushing or even removal. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.

In some cases, you may just need to change your dog’s diet to firm up their stools.

Can all dogs get blocked anal glands? Yes, all dog breeds can develop blocked anal glands. Around 4% of dogs are affected by it each year. The risk of impacted anal glands is higher in older dogs and there are certain breeds that are more at risk than others. The Kennel Club have more information about this.
If you’re thinking of adopting a dog with anal gland problems
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new dog and ask for more details on how the condition has been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any dog who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.          "
How to house your guinea pigs,"Providing your guinea pigs with a spacious home and a secure outdoor run will help keep them active, happy and healthy. There are certain requirements for both indoor and outdoor piggies. Here we talk you through the ideal enclosure sizes, recommended runs, pros and cons.

&nbsp;
Housing a pair of guinea pigs:
Whether you choose an indoor or an outdoor set up, here’s how much space your guinea pigs will need. For males, it’s best to give them as much room as possible, otherwise they tend to squabble!

Hutch or indoor cage – 5 ft long by 2 ft deep (153 cm by 61 cm), single tier.

Run for the garden – 6 ft long by 4 ft wide by 18 inches high (182cm x 122cm x 46cm) wooden framed run with a removable/hinged lid.

&nbsp;
Housing a trio of guinea pigs:
Hutch or indoor cage – 6ft by 2ft (182cm by 61cm), single tier.

Run for the garden – 6ft long by 4ft wide by 18 inches high (182cm by 122cm) wooden framed run with a removable/hinged lid.

Groups of four or more guinea pigs will need a larger indoor setup or a converted shed/Wendy House, along with a bigger run for the garden. If you’d like more information about this, don’t hesitate to contact our friendly team!

Guinea pigs can live indoors or outdoors – and there are pros and cons to consider for each.

&nbsp;
Indoor accommodation
Pros:

 	Your guinea pigs are likely to become more confident around you and being hand-fed.
 	You’re more likely to spot health concerns. In fact, the risk of fungal and respiratory issues may be reduced as your guinea pigs will be in a dry, warm environment.
 	They’ll be safe from wild predators and bad weather.

Cons:

 	It may be tricky to dedicate an entire room for your guinea pigs that gives them the peace and quiet they need.
 	If you have cats or dogs, they might take a keen interest in your guinea pigs, causing your pets to become stressed.
 	They’ll have less opportunities to graze on grass. If they’re given time outside, they will need time to acclimatise to the temperatures.
 	You may be allergic to their bedding, which isn’t ideal.

&nbsp;
Outdoor accommodation
Pros:

 	They will enjoy living in a large, private area. Especially if you use a Wendy House or shed.
 	Provides a calmer and quiet area away from household noises and other pets such as dogs and cats. This will boost all your pets’ well-being.
 	It’s easier to allow them to graze throughout the year, as they will be more acclimatised to the weather.
 	It’s safer if anyone in your home suffers from allergies.

Cons:

 	You won’t be spending all day outdoors so less opportunity to socialise with your guinea pigs.
 	They’re more likely to have health issues that go unnoticed for longer periods.
 	They’ll be at risk of wild predators such as foxes, stoats and rats if their enclosure is not secure.
 	The weather can be an issue – there’s the risk of them becoming cold and damp during the winter and overheating during the summer.
  Can guinea pigs live indoors?
Guinea pigs can be housed indoors and there are lots of benefits of this. Indoor cages come in different sizes, but if you have a smaller one, it leaves little opportunity for you to be creative with their environment.

For inspiration, take a look at some C&amp;C examples. They have a range of affordable modular cages. They’re more suited to empty spaces in your home. But due to their open-top design, they’re not suited to homes with cats, dogs or young children.
Where to place your indoor cage
Guinea pigs are a prey species and are easily scared by loud noises. So avoid placing them in busy, noisy rooms like the living room, kitchen or a play room. Keep their enclosure away from any draughts throughout the year and hot sunny windows in the summer.

&nbsp;
How long do guinea pigs live indoors?
Guinea pigs housed indoors don’t live any longer than outdoor guinea pigs. There are equal benefits of both accommodation preferences. As long as you’re meeting the five welfare needs for your piggies, they’ll live happy and healthy lives.

If you temporarily move your guinea pigs indoors during the winter months, you should keep them in until the weather is much warmer and the temperature outdoors is similar to that indoors. Otherwise they will struggle to adjust from the temperature difference of being in a heated home to the temperature outside during the cold months.

&nbsp;
Can guinea pigs live outdoors?
Yes! Guinea pigs can be housed and live outdoors. This is probably in fact the best place for them to live as they can be acclimatised to the weather all year round.

There are many single-level hutches available in pet stores and online. But many are very poorly made and often fall apart within the first two years. So consider investing a little more, if you can, with a welfare-approved hutch company and get yourself a hutch which is made of strong wood. Your hutch should also have suitable bolts on the doors – cunning predators can easily open hutches with swivel latches.

Double-level hutches are not ideal for guinea pigs. Although some will use both levels, most only end up using one, as the ramps are usually quite steep and provide little grip, if any at all. They’re also at risk of falling down the ramp or floor hole when they’re elderly and less mobile. Chicken coops or plastic pods are also not suitable for guinea pigs. The housing area is often very small and can become damp and mouldy. It also offers limited space if the run area is too wet.

&nbsp;
What can you do in winter?
If you go with the hutch option, make sure you have a plan of action for when winter comes. Many hutches now come with ventilated covers, allowing the hutch to be outside all year round. The best protection will come from placing the hutch inside a shed or well-ventilated outbuilding with natural daylight. This will help to keep them warm and safe from predators.

Converted sheds and Wendy Houses
Did you know, wooden Wendy Houses or garden sheds make the ideal home for guinea pigs? To create a guinea pig shed, all you need to do is install a mesh door for ventilation and a step over barrier to stop any escapees. A shed offers more floor space for the guinea pigs, which means more room to explore! It also means you can socialise with your guinea pig, whatever the weather.

If you fancy a bit of a project, check out our article on converting a shed for guinea pigs. Steer clear of plastic children’s play houses. These can get very hot in the summer months, so not a very suitable choice.

&nbsp;
Outdoor run
Guinea pigs are natural-born grazers! On sunny, dry days, they love spending time on the grass and need a minimum of four-six hours to graze. Alternatively, they should have access to a good mixture of safe garden plants. There are plenty of other benefits of the great outdoors. Guinea pigs are more likely to fight with their companions if they’re confined to a hutch for long periods of time. On top of that, there’s a greater risk of them suffering from health conditions due to a lack of Vitamin D.

The garden run will need to be:

 	6ft x 4ft in size for 2-3 guinea pigs
 	wooden framed with a removable/hinged lid to allow easy access to the guinea pigs
 	well-built to prevent predators and young children trying to climb in when you’re not able to supervise

Your guinea pigs will need multiple hiding areas/tunnels spread throughout their whole run – the more the better. They don’t feel safe grazing in open spaces – it’s a big, wide world out there for such small pets. So you’ll often find them hiding in one corner or under the only shelter available. It’s a good idea to provide multiple options for them to move between. For ideas on how to make your guinea pigs feel at home, see our advice.

Avoid metal and A-frame runs

Metal folding runs and A-frames are not suitable for guinea pigs. Metal runs often don’t have a secure lid, are flimsy against predators and weather, and guinea pigs can get trapped or injured due to the large mesh spacing. A-frames generally only have one door so rounding up the guinea pigs can be very tricky. And they’re rarely available in the required minimum size. It’s probably best to avoid them altogether!

&nbsp;
DIY dos and don’ts
Before you get started on your grand design, it’s vital you have the right materials. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

 	Chicken wire is not suitable for animal housing – it’s too weak and easy for predators to break in to.
 	Use small gauge, strong welded mesh. Nail or heavy-duty staple the mesh onto the inside of the run to prevent your guinea pigs from chewing the framework.
 	Place secure bolts on doors of outdoor hutches, sheds and runs – predators and young children can easily open swivel latches or flimsy bolts.
 	Run lids will need to be strong enough to withhold a predator or windblown items landing on them. Ideally, make it in three sections with a supporting beam to aid the strength and prevent dipping in the middle.
 	Use suitable wood screws to secure the run panels together – cable ties are not suitable.

How many guinea pigs should you keep?,"When it comes to deciding whether to keep guinea pigs, you might have lots of questions on your lips including how many guinea pigs should I get? Just remember if you love guinea pigs and want to bring one home, you should get two or more to keep them happy and healthy. Here’s some information on how to help your guinea pigs become furever friends.

&nbsp;
Suitable combinations

 	Two or more sows (female guinea pigs)
 	Two boars (male guinea pigs) – now this can be tricky! Mixing two single boars together can take multiple introductions to single males before a good match is found. If you have a pair under one year old, there is a risk that they may start to fight as they mature. This could lead to them needing to be separated.
 	A neutered boar with one or more sows.

&nbsp;
Can three male guinea pigs live together?
You should think very carefully when it comes to housing three sibling boars together. Although they often start off living together well, one guinea pig is likely to be badly bullied. So there’s a high risk of them fighting and needing to be separated in the future.

The same goes for a boar with a young male under one year old. Although the mix may work at first, when the young male matures he will compete for dominancy, which could result in serious fights.

&nbsp;
Unsuitable combinations
A rabbit and a guinea pig should not live together. Although some owners have found that a rabbit and guinea pig can live happily in each other’s company, there’s a risk that the guinea pig will be accidentally kicked when the rabbit is running and hopping about. Communication is a big factor to consider as well. Guinea pigs are vocal communicators, whereas rabbits are mostly silent, and this can be upsetting for both species.

&nbsp;
How to introduce your guinea pigs to each other
If you find yourself with a single guinea pig, or you’d like to expand your herd, we can help! Woodgreen’s onsite mixing service is a lifeline for owners looking for support with finding their single guinea pigs a lasting companion. This could involve mixing onsite or providing you with advice on how to mix them at home.

&nbsp;
Do guinea pigs need to be in pairs?
Guinea pigs thrive in the company of other guinea pigs and the best combination is a pair of guinea pigs, but they don’t necessarily need to be in pairs. If you have a group of three or more that live happily together, that’s great!

&nbsp;
Preparing to mix guinea pigs
When introducing guinea pigs, it’s very important this is done on neutral ground. Start in the morning so you have the whole day to watch them closely. It’s best to mix them in the outside run where they have lots of space and grass. If you do mix indoors, make sure they have plenty of space.
Your mixing check-list:

 	Clean the mixing area with pet-friendly disinfectant.
 	Add new/clean open-ended tunnels and hides (at least one per guinea pig, or more if you are able to add them in).
 	Scatter plenty of hay throughout the mixing area and under hiding spaces.
 	Scatter their pelleted food and/or any forage or veg.
 	Watch our video below for information on choosing the right companion for your guinea pig, how to mix them, and the behaviours to look out for.
  Starting the bonding process
Once your mixing area is up and running, your guinea pigs are ready to enter. Place them in at the same time and allow them to explore their new surroundings and approach each other in their own time. Guinea pigs will often show signs of bonding or aggression fairly quickly.
Signs your guinea pigs may accept each other

 	Eating close to each other.
 	Grooming each other’s faces.
 	Happy gentle squeaks.
 	Calmly following each other.

Signs your guinea pigs may not accept one another

 	Rearing their heads up at each other with open mouths (Raising head over other guinea pigs to show dominance)
 	Chattering of teeth.
 	Regularly walking to the side with their rump in the air.
 	Fur standing on end.

If you see the following during a mix or between an already bonded pair, you should separate the guinea pigs immediately.

 	Attacking the face or rump.
 	Signs of injury/blood – call your guinea pig friendly vet so they can be checked over.

Health check all guinea pigs daily to spot any hidden injuries. When mixing a group, make sure you watch them carefully to make sure there is no bullying.

If mixing is taking place indoors and everything is going well by the late afternoon/early evening, leave them in that space overnight.

If you choose to mix outdoors, make sure their main living space has been thoroughly cleaned. Then move their hiding spaces and hay from their mixing space into their normal living area – this will help the guinea pigs settle in the environment as it will smell like both of them. Keep a close eye on them to make sure they settle into the new space before leaving them overnight.

&nbsp;
Neutering: what you need to know
Vets don’t typically agree to neutering female guinea pigs, unless it’s necessary to treat another illness. This is because it can come with many complications.

Males can be neutered if they will not pair with a male and need to be mixed with females.

Unlike other species, neutering a male guinea pig will not affect their behaviour, so it’s not a solution to a fighting pair of males. If you do have to get your guinea pigs neutered, choose a vet who specialises in small pets and has lots of experience in neutering guinea pigs to ensure a swift recovery.        "
Getting a puppy: what you need to know,"Puppies can make a wonderful addition to the family, but they take a lot of hard work, dedication and training to become a well-rounded adult. Make sure you have the time and patience for a puppy. If you think an older dog would suit you better, read our guide to getting an older dog. 
Also, read our guide on what to think about before you get a dog to find out more about your duties as a pet owner and the costs of getting a puppy.
It’s important not to rush your decision to get a puppy or your search for one. Here are some tips on how to make an informed choice.

Adopt a puppy from Woodgreen
Dogs are put into our care every day, including puppies from eight weeks old. Apply to adopt a dog here. We receive many requests for puppies, but if we're able to match a puppy with you, then Woodgreen will:


 	provide a full character and health assessment
 	provide age-appropriate neutering
 	vaccinate your puppy
 	treat the puppy for fleas and worms before you take it home
 	give you information and the paperwork about your puppy
 	give you support and advice throughout your puppy’s life.

Woodgreen are a member of the Association of Dogs and Cats Homes members website. You can find other dog rehoming organisations there, as well as on the Kennel Club's 'Find a Rescue Dog website.

Buy a puppy from a reputable source
Buy your puppy from a knowledgeable, reputable breeder or organization to make sure they’re happy and healthy. Use the Kennel Club's 'Find a puppy' search to find registered breeders. Ideally, you want a Kennel Club Assured Breeder who’s committed to a scheme for responsible breeding. They will give you a record of the puppy’s birth and lineage, and will have been thoroughly checked by the Kennel Club.
From the 6 April 2020, Lucy's Law came into practice, which bans the third-party selling of puppies under 6-months old.
Under The Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) England Regulations 2018, professional dog breeders need a license. So when you approach a breeder or organisation, check:


 	they have a license – they should display their licence number on their advert or website
 	the licence expiry date – contact the local authority if you’re worried
 	the star rating on their licence to get an idea of their welfare standards and performance.

Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have their own regulations, so make sure you research them if you’re getting a dog in those areas.

Find a genuine seller or breeder
Genuine sellers and breeders know all about their dog breed. Don’t be afraid to ask questions – they will be happy to tell you what you need to know. Genuine sellers or breeders will also:


 	be keen to meet you and ask you plenty of questions
 	often not want or expect you to take the puppy on the first meeting
 	be happy for you to visit the puppy several times before you take it home
 	show you where the puppy was born
 	let you meet the mother and the rest of the litter
 	provide all the relevant paperwork and health records
 	be happy to sign a Puppy Contract with all the details about the puppy, its history and health.

Warning signs
There are various signs that can help you decide if the seller or breeder is not responsible and trustworthy. For example, if:


 	an advertiser says they can get you any breed or sells several different breeds – the dogs may be from puppy farms
 	advertisers seem to have puppies constantly for sale
 	multiple adverts have the same mobile number or description of the puppy – google the information to see if it’s been used in lots of adverts
 	a seller is reluctant to give out their contact information
 	a seller wants to meet at unusual times or places – like a car park or lay-by
 	a seller is reluctant to let you meet the puppy’s mother or says she’s at the vet or on a walk
 	a seller says a health issue like snoring or back problems is “normal for the breed”
 	a seller doesn’t have the puppy’s paperwork available or says they will post it on to you
 	a seller is reluctant to show you where the puppies were born
 	puppies are being advertised as having a passport – they may have been imported
 	popular breeds are advertised at an unusually low price
 	puppies are being advertised as vaccinated at four weeks old or less – puppies can’t be vaccinated before the age of four weeks.

Beware buying online
Be extremely careful who you buy from. There are people are genuinely trying to find their puppies loving new homes, but many others are not. Some advertisers are less honest, and are just looking to make money.
Buying online increases the risk of buying from a puppy farm. Puppies from puppy farms often have severe mental and physical problems because they’re bred for profit not health or temperament. The puppies are often taken away from their mother too early and haven’t really been socialised. This can lead to behavioural problems later in life. 
There are also many internet scams. For example, people asking for money for couriers or deposits upfront when you haven’t yet seen the dog – which might not even exist. So check all the details thoroughly, and do not part with any money until you have your puppy and its paperwork.
If you’re going to use the internet to help you find a puppy, look for websites that follow the Defra-endorsed minimum standards set by the Pet Advertising Advisory Group. These include:


 	Gumtree
 	Preloved
 	Pets4Homes
 	Friday Ads
 	VivaStreet

If you see an advert from an “Assured Breeder” in a newspaper or on a website, search for their name on the Kennel Club database. You need to check they’re a registered breeder before you do anything else.

How to check a puppy
Make sure you get a healthy, happy puppy. Look out for:


 	if it's in a place it was born - if it's not, this is often a sign the puppy was born in poor conditions
 	where it lives is suitable and clean, with things like food and water bowls, bedding and toys
 	for ‘fake’ mothers – look for signs the mother has given birth, like enlarged mammary glands, and make sure she isn’t ignoring the puppies as this can show she’s not their mum
 	how it interacts with its mother and the rest of the litter - for example if it’s nervous and withdrawn it may be like that with other animals when you take it home
 	it appears alert and healthy – for example, look for:
 	active, friendly behaviour – they shouldn’t be afraid
 	clean, clear and bright eyes
 	clean ears
 	clean, dry bottom
 	cold, clean, slightly wet nose
 	clean, dry skin and a soft, shiny, flea-free coat
 	clean white teeth and pink gums
 	any problems like laboured breathing, limping or visible ribs
 	its medical records, including the vaccination certificate and flea and worming treatment record – ask the seller or breeder for them
 	all the paperwork to confirm the breeder or seller is the right person to pass the puppy to you
 	it’s old enough to leave its mother – at least eight weeks old.

You don’t have to decide to take the puppy there and then. If you have concerns, say you have other dogs to meet before you decide. If you’re worried about the puppy’s health it's best to look for another puppy.

What to ask a dog breeder or seller
Take this list of questions with you when you go to see a puppy, so you can get all the information you need:


 	Can I see the puppy with its mum?
 	How old is the puppy?
 	Is the puppy fully weaned (they can eat food other than the mother’s milk)?
 	How old is the mum? How many litters has she had? What is her temperament like?
 	Who is the puppy’s dad? Can I contact his owner to find out more about him?
 	Is the puppy healthy? Has it had its vaccinations? When is the next dose due? Can I see the records?
 	Has the puppy been wormed? When is the next dose due? Can I see the records?
 	Is the puppy microchipped? By law, the breeder must microchip puppies before they turn eight weeks old.
 	What is the puppy being fed? Is there a diet guide available?
 	What socialisation and experiences has the puppy had so far?
 	Is the puppy pedigree? If so, is it registered with the Kennel Club? Can I see the paperwork?
 	Can I return the puppy if it has any health problems?

Your rats' health: what to look out for,"The key to helping your rats remain healthy and happy is a good, varied diet and high standards of hygiene. Make sure you find a vet who has chosen to specialise in small mammals to get the best possible care for your rats.

Your rats’ life expectancy
Rats live on average for between two and three years.

Parasites and fur loss
These can be relatively common in young or elderly rats, especially if they’ve come from poor conditions. It can be tricky to spot mites, however lice can be quite clearly seen if the fur is brushed gently backwards. If your rats have lice you will see very small orange/light brown parasites wriggling on the skin and moving in the hair. Mites are nearly impossible to see so being aware of common symptoms is important:


 	Intensive itching and scratching
 	Small scratch wounds along the shoulders and back
 	Hair loss
 	Crusts forming along the ears, tail or nose

Most mites and lice can be treated with 0.1% ivermectin, which is available from your vet. Make sure you react quickly as parasites can be very distressing for rats.

Breathing problems
Sadly, respiratory infections are very a common illness in rats. These are caused by bacteria in the respiratory tract, which makes the rat unwell. Rats with pre-existing respiratory conditions can also be exasperated by stress as a result of a new rat food, poor ventilation, change in temperatures, bullying by other rats and old age.
Along with medical support from your vet, choosing suitable bedding, cleaning the cage to a high standard, washing the hammocks and bars of the cage, and having a cage that is well-ventilated will all help to help prevent and manage this illness.

Contact your vet if you notice the following symptoms:

 	Sneezing
 	Rattling sound from the chest, you can often feel this when handling your rat
 	Laboured breathing, giving the chest a concaved appearance
 	Blood-like spotting, brow or red colouring around the inside of the legs, face, eyes and flanks known as porphyrin staining
 	Generally looking fluffed and poorly

Back leg problems
As rats age, they can become prone to back leg weakness. This is often referred to as hind leg degeneration or HLD. It’s particularly common in male rats. You may notice your rat appear wobbly or one or both legs starting to drag when they walk.
Keeping your rats fit when they are young through fun activities that challenge your rats to climb all around their cage and free-range time will help reduce their chances.
If you do notice any changes in movement, speak to your vet and make modifications to your cage. Reducing the height of platforms and hammocks, and remove activities like ladders and ropes that they may fall from. Lumps, bumps and tumours
Tumours and non-aggressive lumps are very common in rats, especially females. These can develop as young as a year old, so health check your rats regularly – feeling all over the body, in particular under the armpits, groin and neck.
Non-aggressive lumps can be left or removed depending on your vets’ recommendation and your rat’s general condition, but they rarely grow quickly. They are often pea-sized at the beginning but can grow very large with time, which may impact on your rat’s quality of life in the long-term.
Aggressive, often cancerous, lumps can grow extremely quickly, doubling in size in a matter of weeks. Removal is possible, although you should discuss this with an experienced vet and take into account the rats’ general condition and age.

Neutering your rats
Although routinely rats are not neutered, it is possible and can have many benefits. If you do choose to neuter your rats, choose an experienced vet.
After neutering, bed your rats on towels or fleece to avoid loose bedding getting in or affecting the wound healing. Change their bedding daily to limit the amount of urine and bacteria in contact with the wound. Monitor their eating and drinking, and offer them warm comfort food and tasty, healthy snacks for a few days after the operation to get them eating and help them heal.
It is essential to neuter hormonally aggressive rats so they can stay in a bonded pair or group, as they need company. In addition, hormonally aggressive rats can turn their aggression towards humans as well as other rats. Other benefits of neutering include:


 	Prevents unwanted litters
 	Many health benefits to females
 	Reduces chances of hormonally-driven tumours
 	Aids the chances of finding suitable companions for feisty male rats

Should I get a dog? What to think about," So, where to start? From cost, breed and age to diet and lifestyle, there are many things to consider before getting a dog. Fortunately, you’re in the right place to help you weight up the pros and cons and make an informed decision. And if you’re still unsure, just get in touch for any more advice you might need!

So...should I get a dog?

Here are the top questions you should ask yourself:

Is a dog definitely the right pet for me?
Does everyone at home want a dog?
Do I have time for a dog?
Can I give the dog everything it needs?
Can I afford a dog?
What if I already have pets?
What dog should I get – a puppy or an older dog?
Which dog breed is right for me?

Click on one of the questions above to see the answer (or scroll down this page).

We hope the questions and advice below will help you find the answer. Is a dog definitely the right pet for me?
You might be a dog lover through and through but have you ever thought about why you really want a dog? Think about all the things you want from a canine companion and what you want to give them. Taking the time to consider the right pet that fits into your world will ensure you both live happy and fulfilling lives together. Does everyone at home want a dog?
Everyone who will be living with the dog needs to feel comfortable. Think about who will be the primary care giver. If anyone is worried or unhappy about getting a dog, you might like to consider a different pet. Do I have time for a dog?
Dogs live on average between 8-16 years, depending on the breed. And every dog needs daily exercise and stimulation. They’re also very sociable animals, and many can’t cope being home alone for hours every day. So make sure you can give them plenty of time and attention. Thinking about getting a puppy? Check out our advice on socialising young dogs. Can I give the dog everything it needs?
Every dog deserves the very best care from their human. To achieve that, it’s vital that you look after their five welfare needs, which is covered in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. These are listed below:
1. Environment
All dogs need a safe, loving and stable home. Their environment should have enough space to eat, rest, sleep, rest and exercise.
2. Diet 
Your dog should be fed a suitable diet for their breed and size. They need the right amount of nutritional dog food and constant fresh water. We recommend feeding a good quality complete diet, free from colourings, additives and preservatives. You can bulk out your dog’s diet with tinned meat if you need to, but don’t overfeed them. Obesity causes health problems and shortens life expectancy. Every dog is different, so you must make sure you understand what yours needs. For example, neutered dogs or senior dogs don’t need as many calories as other dogs.

Learn more about what to feed your dog
3. Behaviour 
Dogs should have the ability to behave naturally for their species and breed. Some dogs like running exercise, while others enjoy retrieving such as fetching a toy back, and others may like tug-of-war games.

Playing search games with a toy can be a great outlet for behaviour. Ideally, most need two good walks a day with time off the lead to explore and run around. And don’t forget mental stimulation, like training, games and food-based activity toys. Enjoy doing your research to find out what your dog likes!

We have lots of behaviour articles, events and courses for dog owners 
4. Companionship
Dogs are sociable and need to interact and play with people and other dogs. But just like us humans they also need a quiet place to be alone when they want.
5. Health 
Protection from pain, injury, suffering and disease is a very important part of pet ownership. You will need to register your dog with a vet and keep them up to date with vaccinations, flea and worming treatments. This will help fend off disease and infections that can be hard to get rid of. If your dog shows signs of illness, you must take them to the vet as soon as possible. And if they get seriously ill or have poor quality of life, you must be prepared to make extremely difficult decisions about their future. Giving your dog vet care is part of being a responsible owner. But it can be expensive, so we recommend you get pet insurance. Always do your research before you buy insurance, and ask for recommendations and advice from your vet.

The cost of buying a dog is just the beginning. You need to factor in the cost of everything from food and vet care to toys and training, throughout their life. You should also allow for dog walking and holiday care costs, so your dog stays stimulated and well cared for if you’re not around.
Here’s what you need to budget for:

 	Pet insurance (the monthly cost plus the excess to pay on claims)
 	Vet costs (without insurance this could be thousands)
 	Vaccinations and yearly boosters
 	Regular worming and flea treatment
 	Neutering
 	Good-quality dog food, and a food bowl and water bowl
 	Leads and collars
 	Identity tag and microchip (you could be fined if your dog is not microchipped)
 	Dog bed
 	Socialisation classes and training classes and aids
 	A harness or crate for the car
 	Dog toys
 	Kennel or dog sitting fees if you’re going away
 	Dog walker fees if you’re out for more than a few hours a day.

What if my lifestyle changes in the future?
If you’re moving, changing jobs, going back to work or having a baby in the next six months, think carefully about getting a dog, and what impact the change could have on them. What if I already have pets?
How would a new dog affect any pets you already have at home? For older pets or those with health conditions, the introduction of new housemates could be particularly difficult for them. What dog should I get – a puppy or an older dog?
Although puppies can make a wonderful addition to the family, they take a lot of time, hard work, dedication, training and patience to become a well-rounded adult. If you think you’re ready for a puppy, read our guide to getting a puppy.

There are also plenty of older dogs looking for new homes, and they can make fantastic family pets. They still need plenty of attention, but have been through the tricky house-training stage. If you’d like to give an older dog a loving home, have a look at our guide to getting an older dog. Which dog breed is right for me?
There are many different dog breeds, with different needs and energy levels. Research each breed thoroughly to see if it suits your lifestyle. Don’t just consider size.

Feeding your guinea pigs,"What to feed your guinea pigs 
To help your guinea pigs live a long and healthy life, their diet should be as natural and varied as possible.

Guinea pigs are herbivores who need a full belly of fibre at all times. In the wild, they would live in dense foliage and spend their days grazing, so a healthy daily diet should include the following:
Hay
Hay makes up 85% of a guinea pig’s diet. Your small furry friends need constant access to hay or grass. They’re on their feet all day and constantly eating. In fact, your guinea pigs should be eating a pile of hay the same size as themselves every day.

It’s also great for helping to keep their teeth healthy! Spread the hay around their whole enclosure, run space and under hiding spaces. Offer a mixture of varieties such as:

 	Baled mixed meadow hay.
 	Forage treat hay by Burgess.
 	Small amounts of Timothy Hay or Readigrass.

Avoid short, brown or yellow, dusty-smelling hay as it lacks in nutrition and may harm your guinea pigs.
Pellets
5% of a guinea pig’s diet should be made up of good-quality pellets. They should be fed around an eggcup’s worth (20g) per day. Guinea pigs should not be fed muesli mixes as they are high in sugar and can lead to dental problems. Here at Woodgreen, we feed our guinea pigs on Burgess Excel pellets, which you can buy online or from most pet shops.
Safe plants and vegetables
The remaining 10% of their diet should be made up of plants and vegetables. This is about a handful per guinea, per day. Give them a variety of different fresh foods each day. You can also pick and grow your own foods to feed them – see our list of safe foods below.
Water
It’s vital that your guinea pigs have access to fresh water every day. Many guinea pigs prefer to drink from a bowl. Bottles are suitable but can often leak and be tricky to clean.

Foraging wild and garden plants for your guinea pigs
Foraging for your guinea pigs is a cost-effective and organic way of feeding them. Some forage, like stinging nettles and rose petals, can be dried out and given as treats later in the year. Other plants such as vegetables, or soft leaves like mallow can be fed on the day.
How to forage safely:

 	Use suitable secateurs and garden gloves for prickly plants!
 	Take a plant ID or forage book with you so you don’t pick dangerous plants.
 	Don’t pick from areas close to the road or areas likely to have been toileted on by dogs and cats.
 	Only pick from gardens and areas you know are free from chemicals.
 	Introduce new foods slowly to avoid a bad reaction to the sudden change

Foods to avoid feeding to guinea pigs:
Dry mixes made with lots of colourings, dried fruits and cereals can have a negative effect on your guinea pigs’ health. If the mix is made with lots of dried soft fruit or peas your guinea pigs are likely to suffer with dental or urinary problems.

Colourful treats, sticky honey-based treats, salt licks and mineral blocks can all be harmful to your guinea pigs. If you’re feeding them a good quality natural diet, you won’t need any form of supplements.          "
Your guinea pigs' health: what to look out for,"Make sure you health check your guinea pigs weekly and look out for any changes in their behaviour every day. Sometimes even the smallest thing, such as their poo looking a little smaller than normal or not rushing out to receive fresh food straight away, can be a clue to a poorly guinea pig. If you have any concerns, act quickly and contact your guinea pig savvy vet.

Watch our video on how to health check them, what to look out for and how to clip their nails below.  How to health check your guinea pig
Ideally, bring your guinea pigs indoors for this and sit them on a towel so they are comfy.
Weight 
Adult males will usually weigh between 800-1200g, females 800-1000g. Use some small scales, like kitchen scales to monitor their weight. Use the PFMA size-o-meter to help with visually checking their size.
Eyes 
Should be clean, clear and bright
Ears, nose and mouth
Should be clean, free of any discharge, flaky and scabby patches. No noisy breathing.
Teeth 
Top and bottom incisors (front teeth) should be white, smooth and wearing evenly against one another.
Body
Should be free of any lumps or bumps. These often appear under their chin, along their back or in their armpit area.
Skin and coat 
Should be:

 	clean and healthy looking
 	no fur loss
 	no red, flaky skin/dandruff
 	no wounds
 	no matted fur

Bottom and genitals 
Should be clean. Adult males over one year of age will need their genitals checking and cleaning regularly. For more information, see below.
Feet and toes
Should be free of any sores.
Nails 
Nails will need to be clipped every four to six weeks once they have reached around one year old. Watch the video above on how to do this, or contact us if you would like more support or a mini lesson.

Finding a vet
It’s really important to find a vet in your area who has lots of experience with small pets like guinea pigs. Most vets will see cats and dogs on a daily basis and will have an extensive knowledge of their needs. Other species such as guinea pigs will rarely be seen by most vets. So finding someone who has lots of experience of seeing, diagnosing and treating these species is essential.

 	Look for an Exotics Veterinary Practice – they may have more experience and might be cheaper than other vets.
 	Talk to friends and family who own or have owned guinea pigs to see if there are any vets in particular that they recommend.
 	Talk to veterinary practices to find out if there are any guinea pig savvy vets within the practice. Don’t be afraid to ask them how many they see on a weekly basis to help you decide whether they are the right vet for you.

&nbsp;
Grooming and bathing 
Long-haired guinea pigs need daily grooming to avoid their fur from becoming matted. This can happen pretty quickly if bedding becomes tangled within their fur. You may also notice the fur around their bottom becoming discoloured and tangled. It’s worth grooming them regularly and bathing them up to twice a year will help with this. Trimming the long fur a little bit around this area to prevent it from dragging along the floor will also help.

All guinea pigs can be bathed once or twice a year in piggy safe products. This helps to keep their coat clean and healthy, and can help protect them from skin issues. Guinea pigs have a grease gland in the spot where a tail would normally be. Male guinea pigs can get quite greasy in this area and their fur can become matted. When bathing, make sure you give this area a good clean as well. Trimming the fur carefully around here for particularly greasy guinea pigs can help keep the area ventilated protected from fungal conditions.

&nbsp;
Skin conditions
It’s quite common for guinea pigs to suffer with various skin issues including fur mites, running lice, burrowing mites, fungal infections and ringworm.

As you can imagine, any of these skin issues can be extremely uncomfortable for your little piggies and in extreme circumstances, some issues can be life threatening. It’s best to contact your guinea pig friendly vet if you spot any of these symptoms:

 	Fur loss
 	Red or flaky skin and dandruff
 	Itching or suddenly biting you
 	Unexplained open wounds
 	Unable to gain weight
 	Scabby patches around face and ears
 	V-like shape of chewed fur down back
 	Dull, dry-looking coat – your piggy may appear puffed up

Housing your guinea pigs in suitable accommodation is key to reducing their risk of developing skin conditions. You should make sure their accommodation is kept dry and clean with the correct bedding. It’s best to bathe your guinea pigs twice a year in piggy-safe products to protect their skin.

A product we recommend at Woodgreen is Ivermectin. It helps prevent parasites and keeps your guinea pigs healthy. Make sure you carefully follow the recommendations on the package on how to use it. And if you notice any signs of disease, get your guinea pig checked by a vet – they will be able to advise you on the best treatment.

&nbsp;
Looking after boys’ bits!
Most male guinea pig owners don’t realise they need a little extra care and observation. Males over a year old need to have their penis cleaned every few months. This involves gently pushing down above the exposed skin and cleaned with damp cotton wool. This area is prone to a build-up of cheese-like discharge, which can eventually prevent your guinea pig from weeing normally.

Large dominant males can also be prone to ‘impaction' from around three years old onwards. This is a rather smelly situation but can be fatal if not spotted and managed correctly. Impaction causes the anus to bulge, and a large ball of faeces will appear to be blocking him – despite a few normal poos in the cage. Speak to your guinea pig savvy vet if you spot this.
&nbsp;
Urinary health
Both male and female guinea pigs are prone to cystitis and stones. Keep an eye on them for any wetness around their back end, odours and small amounts of blood in the urine or a single painful squeak when toileting. A vet with experience in guinea pigs will happily give you advice and support with both issues.
&nbsp;
Dental health
Some guinea pigs can be more prone to dental problems than others, although it’s not as common as with rabbits. When giving your guinea pigs their weekly health check, take a good look at the front teeth or incisors. You’ll see two teeth at the top and two at the bottom – they should be white and smooth and clearly wearing against each other. If your piggy is missing a tooth, or you notice that one or more are a lot longer, or they're wearing down at an angle, contact your guinea pig friendly vet.

A guinea pig’s diet should be made up of 85% hay. Generally, we say they should be eating a pile of hay the same size as themselves each day. Not only will this help keep them in good health, it’s also great for keeping their teeth in good condition. We wouldn’t recommend feeding your guinea pigs muesli mixes as they are high in sugar and can lead to dental problems. A good swap for this is an egg cup of pellets each per day. Providing them with fresh forage including apple branches and willow twigs, as well as giving them opportunities to graze on grass, will help keep their teeth in good shape. For more information, check out our article on how to look after your guinea pig’s teeth.        "
How many rats can live together?,"Rat companionship
Rats can live in pairs, although a trio or more is as they create their own social network. Pairs of rats can sometimes get agitated with one another and will tend to show dominant behaviour. Time spent out of the cage and fun training can help prevent this.

It’s best for rats to live together in same-sex groups. However, males can be castrated so they can be mixed with females if they don’t bond well with other male rats. Females can also be neutered by experienced, rat-friendly vets if they are particularly tricky to mix.
Introducing your rats to each other
Unlike the other small pet species, introducing rats is best done in a smaller neutral space, this reduces the chance of potentially dangerous fights starting out and encourages mutual feeding, grooming and the building of strong relationships quicker.

Always start mixes early in the morning so you have plenty of time to monitor initial interactions.  The size of space very much depends on the number of rats that are going to be mixed, if mixing 1-4 rats, a top opening cat carrier is ideal.

Place some bedding on the floor such as short shredded paper and scatter a small amount of food on the floor with a water bottle attached to the side. Avoid placing any enrichment or hides/hammocks in at this stage.

Place the rats in at the same time, expect to see quite a bit of activity at first whilst they assess who is who and decide who is going to be dominant.
Typical acceptable behaviours likely to be seen include:

 	Bottom sniffing
 	Shuffling round the bedding
 	The more dominant potentially fluffing their coats and regularly placing their paws on the back on the others to try to be assertive.
 	Self-grooming
 	Small amount of squeaking
 	Submissive rats will move around less
 	All rats choosing to sit apart after a few moments of initial full on activity
 	Eventually falling asleep curled up alone during the first few hours
 	Sleep bundles when they are more content.

In most cases the rats will need to stay in this small space for 24 hours and in some cases when doing a tricky mix with rats known to be strong characters 48 hours is needed. If the mix is showing positive behaviours and they are choosing to sleep close to each other, movements are slower and there is clearly less tension, you can consider moving them into a slightly bigger space. A large hamster cage with no enrichment is ideal, add some of their bedding from the small space over to the next stage cage and again scatter food and add a water bottle.

If after a few hours they are relaxed, and no signs of a bond brake down is evident, a hammock can be placed in to add a bit or interest.

The rats shouldn’t need to stay in this space for much more than 24 hours, if all rats seem content and a clear hierarchy has been achieved, they can then be placed into their permanent cage.

For the first week or so keep enrichment simple with a few hammocks, ropes and even a suitably sized wheel. Slowly add a few new toys and enrichment items every few days including more enclosed hides until you are at your normal enrichment level.
Keep a close eye on your rats for the first two weeks
Health check each rat regularly throughout the first two weeks of introductions to monitor for any injuries. Fight wounds can get infected, you may need to take your rats to your vet for a check-up.

Your rabbits' health: what to look out for,"Sometimes, even the smallest thing, such as their poo looking a little smaller than normal or not rushing out to receive fresh food straight away, can be a clue to a poorly rabbit. If you have any concerns, act quickly and contact your vet.
&nbsp;
Your rabbits' life expectancy
Rabbits tend to live for between 8 and 12 years, though many survive into their teens.
&nbsp;
How to health check your rabbit

 	Ideally, bring your rabbits indoors and sit them on a towel so they are comfy.
 	Use some small scales to check their weight. The average breed rabbit, like the dwarf lop, should weigh between 2.2 and 2.5kg once fully grown. Your rabbit should appear lean and pear shaped. Large shoulders or a double chin is a sign of obesity
 	Check their nail length and clip, if needed
 	Feel over their body for any lumps and bumps. These often appear under the jaw line due to dental problems, or along the legs if they have been in a recent fight
 	Check their ears, skin and fur for any signs of parasites
 	Check their eyes. If one or both eyes is weeping, this could mean they have dental disease. Swollen, red, puffy eyelids can also be early signs of myxomatosis
 	Check their mouth and front incisors for any signs of unusual growths
 	Check their nose for any discharge or sounds of noisy breathing
 	Your rabbits should appear bright, alert and inquisitive with a healthy looking coat
 	Monitor their hopping. Rabbits should never appear to walk on their tiptoes. This can indicate spinal problems
 	Check their bottom area for a build-up of faeces, blocked glands or signs of fly strike. All can be an indication that your rabbit is overweight
 	Check that your rabbit doesn’t have head tilt or appears to be swaying to one side. This could be a symptom of E. cuniculi
 	Lastly, check their litter trays and accommodation for any signs of abnormal poo, as this can be an early sign of several life threatening illnesses.
   Always neuter your rabbits
Neutering your rabbits is extremely important to:


 	Prevent unwanted litters
 	Dramatically increase the chances of bonding a pair of rabbits successfully
 	Stop males from spraying and mounting
 	Reduce ‘grumpy’ behaviours
 	Stop females from going through stressful phantom pregnancies
 	Prevent uterine cancer in females, which is very common in rabbits over the age of two years

Male rabbits can be neutered as soon as their testicles have appeared – around four to five months. Females can be neutered from five to six months. Although the procedure is now very straightforward and considered safe, it's extremely important you take your rabbits to a recommended, experienced rabbit vet to avoid complications.
&nbsp;
Rabbits and mites
Rabbits can be prone to mites, which can affect them on the body or around the ears. Signs to look out for include:


 	Flaky dandruff and fur loss between the shoulder blades, known as walking dandruff fur mite
 	Very small, black dots seen when back combing the hair around the rump
 	Head or ear shaking and scratching
 	Blood spots, scabs or crusts building up around the ears

If you spot any of these conditions, take your rabbits along to a rabbit-friendly vet.
&nbsp;
Myxomatosis and VHD
Your rabbits will need vaccinating against Myxomatosis &amp; RVHD1 &amp; 2 (Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic disease) yearly. Both are fatal and easily contracted. Myxomatosis is spread by mosquitos and fleas, so even indoor rabbits are at risk.
Signs of myxomatosis to look out for:


 	Puffy, red or swollen eyes and genital area
 	Small bumps and lumps appearing in the ears and over the body
 	Noisy breathing
 	Sitting hunched and fluffed
 	Eyes shut with a glue-like appearance.

Sadly, once this disease has taken hold of a rabbit it is highly unlikely it will survive. However, it may go on to suffer for up to two weeks before death. Therefore, the kindest option is to consider euthanasia with the support from your veterinary practice.
Rabbit Viral haemorrhagic disease is very much a silent killer &amp; now comes in two strains. RVHD 1 has been around for many years although not found to be that common. RVHD2 appeared in the UK in 2015 and has rapidly spread across the country and responsible for the death of thousands of pet rabbits and the decline in wild rabbits. With little or no symptoms, spores from the virus can be brought to your rabbits on your clothes/foot ware if you’ve unknowingly been in contact with it, or if your rabbit is in contact with a rabbit in the early stages.
If your rabbit passes away suddenly with no obvious reason, it is recommended to agree to have a post-mortem carried out by your veterinary practice. Positive results can then be documented to help track the virus's movements.
Signs of VHD include:


 	Sudden death with no symptoms
 	Jaundice
 	Sudden collapse where death follows within hours
 	Projectile diarrhoea followed quickly by death
 	Loud scream followed by death

&nbsp;
Dental health
Poor dental health is one of the most common killers in rabbits, often because of an incorrect diet. Rabbits should eat a diet of at least 85% hay – if they don’t their teeth may elongate and begin to wear unevenly causing sharp ‘spurs’. These may cause ulceration to the tongue or cheeks. The tooth roots can also break through the jaw bone or grow up into the eye sockets of the rabbit causing pain and abscesses.
Feeding your rabbits the right diet will dramatically reduce the risk and in some cases resolve very early symptoms. Signs to look for include:


 	One or both eyes weeping or blocked tear ducts
 	Weight loss
 	Drooling
 	Mucky bottoms or regularly finding soft stools within the accommodation
 	Lumps/abscess along the jawline
 	Lack of appetite
 	Fly strike
 	Overgrown front teeth with matted fur wrapped around them

A rabbit with perfect teeth can still develop dental issues in later life. Monitor your rabbit closely for signs of problems and visit the vet at least twice a year for regular dental checks.
Unfortunately, dental disease is rarely treatable, only manageable – it can be a very slow and painful end for your rabbit. It may be kinder to euthanise sooner rather than later, with the support of your rabbit-friendly vet.

&nbsp;
Fly strike
Fly strike is very preventable, yet it can come on suddenly and cause your rabbit a lot of pain, and even death. Fly strike happens when a fly lays its eggs around the rump or tail area of the rabbit. These look like small grains of white rice. Maggots quickly hatch out and start to feed on your rabbits’ flesh and move up through the genital area. Rabbits commonly at risk include:


 	Those without litter trays or trays that are not cleaned daily. Using, and regularly cleaning, litter trays reduces the smell that flies are attracted to
 	Elderly, less mobile rabbits
 	Hutch or indoor cage-bound rabbits
 	Long hair breeds prone to becoming matted
 	Obese rabbits with double chins
 	Rabbits with digestive issues that often produce smelly grape-shaped poo

If your rabbit is at risk, they will need daily checks to monitor for any signs of eggs or maggots. If you suspect your rabbit has fly strike, get to a vet immediately as time is very limited.
&nbsp;
Keep an eye on their poo
Although not everyone’s favourite subject, it’s important to monitor your rabbits’ poo regularly for any change in size, shape, consistency, smell or amount. Healthy poo should be around the size and shape of a pea or larger in big breeds. It should be light brown and be made up of lots of hay.
Poo is one of the biggest clues to a poorly rabbit, so if you spot anything unusual, contact your vet. Look out for:


 	Very limited amounts or none seen in the last 12 hours
 	Smaller size or strung together like pearls
 	Coated in a smelly, jelly-like texture. The rabbit may have a very bloated belly and appear to be sitting uncomfortably
 	Very loose poos with a watery consistency

&nbsp;
Is your rabbit obese?
Obesity can cause many health problems in rabbits. Signs of an obese rabbit include:


 	‘Sticky bottom’: a big build-up of smelly faeces around the bottom
 	Regularly seeing lots of soft poos around the hutch. These look very similar to bunches of grapes, just a lot smaller.
 	If you suspect your rabbit is obese, contact your rabbit vet for advice about a change of diet and weight management.
       "
What to feed your rabbits,"Rabbits are herbivores who require a full belly of fibre at all times. A healthy rabbit diet should include the following:


 	Hay makes up 85% of their diet. Your rabbits will need a constant supply of soft, long, green, sweet-smelling hay added fresh in their enclosure for them to graze on. Offer a mixture of varieties such as bales of mixed meadow hay, forage treat hay by Burgess and small amounts of timothy hay or Readigrass. Avoid short, brown or yellow, dusty smelling hay as this may harm your rabbits
 	10% of their diet should be made up of a daily ‘5 a day’ selection of safe plants and vegetables. See the list below for all the healthy fresh foods you can pick and grow
 	Their remaining diet is made up of a good-quality nugget food such as Burgess Excel Rabbit Nuggets. For a medium-sized rabbit, feed around 15g (or 2-3 tablespoons) worth of nuggets once a day. The amount needed for each rabbit will vary, so monitor your rabbits’ weights and adjust the amount of food you give accordingly.

Daily fresh water is extremely important. Many rabbits prefer to drink from a bowl - bottles are suitable but can often leak and be tricky to clean.
&nbsp;
Foraging wild and garden plants for your rabbits
Foraging for your rabbits is a cost-effective and organic way of feeding them. Some forage, like stinging nettles and rose petals, can be dried out and given as treats later in the year. Other plants such as vegetables or soft leaves like mallow can be fed on the day.

How to forage safely

 	Use suitable secateurs and garden gloves for the prickly ones
 	Take a plant ID or forage book with you so you don’t pick dangerous plants
 	Don’t pick from areas close to roadsides or areas likely to have been toileted on by dogs and cats
 	Only pick from gardens and areas you know are free from chemicals
 	Introduce new foods slowly to avoid a bad reaction to the sudden change

&nbsp;
Safe wild plants for rabbits:

 	Blackberry bramble
 	Burdock
 	Campion (red and white)
 	Chickweed
 	Clover
 	Cow parsley
 	Common agrimony
 	Cranesbill

&nbsp;
Safe garden plants and herbs for rabbits
You can feed your rabbits plenty of different garden plants and herbs when they’re in season. Here are some examples:

 	Buddleia
 	Calendula
 	Hollyhocks (leaves)
 	Lavender
 	Nasturtium
 	Roses
 	Sunflowers
 	Wallflowers
 	Wild geranium

 	Fennel
 	Lemon balm
 	Lovage
 	Marjoram
 	Mint
 	Oregano
 	Parsley
 	Rosemary

&nbsp;
Twigs and shrubs for rabbits
The twigs and branches of several trees are a great source of enrichment for your guinea pigs. You can put large branches inside their run and bundle up the smaller twigs and tie them to the sides of the run. Here are some examples:

 	Apple
 	Beech (not the nuts
 	Blackthorn (not the fruits)
 	Crab apple
 	Hawthorn (but remove the thorns for piggies)
 	Hazel (not the nuts)
 	Pear
 	Willow

&nbsp;
Safe fruit and vegetables to grow or buy for rabbits
It is important to remember most fruit and vegetables aren't normally part of a rabbit's diet. Naturally rabbits feed on large quantities of hay/grass and a wide variety of wild weeds, herbs and bark. Feeding any of the below in large and regular amounts can lead to digestive, urinary or weight issues and should ideally be mixed in with a variety of fresh forage.
As an extra, occasional treat, you can give your pets a small piece of apple or pear. Rabbits also love to eat strawberry leaves, blackberry leaves and raspberry leaves.


 	Broccoli
 	Brussel sprouts
 	Cabbage
 	Carrot tops
 	Cauliflower
 	Celery
 	Courgette
 	Curly kale
 	Fennel

&nbsp;
Plants, fruits and vegetables to avoid feeding rabbits

 	Lettuce and many fruits, are the most common cause of loose faeces in rabbits - and have limited nutritional value
 	Carrots are ok in small amounts, but are extremely fattening.
 	Pet shop treats such as yoghurt drops, chew bars etc are very fattening and can contribute to poor dental health.
 	Avocado
 	Ragwort
 	Ivy
 	Privet
 	Holly
 	Yew
 	Hemlock
 	Wild garlic
 	Lords and ladies – common in damp or woody areas.
 	Any plants with bulbs
 	Buttercup leaves and flowers can cause extreme discomfort and in some cases be fatal
 	Foxglove
 	Nightshade
 	House plants such as the spider and rubber plant
 	Potatoes

You should avoid all muesli-style feeds, as they’ve been proven to be one of the most common causes of fatal dental and digestive disease. Colourful treats, sticky honey based treats, salt licks and mineral blocks can all be harmful to your rabbit and are unnecessary. If you’re feeding a good quality, natural diet, you’ll not require any form of supplements.          "
Hamsters: your day-to-day guide,"Feeding your hamster
Hamsters are omnivores, so they need both meat and vegetables in their diet. Feed your hamster a good quality, complete dry mixture that provides their essential nutrients.
There are many good quality foods available for your hamsters. Choose one that has a good mixture of grains, seeds, pulses and a meat source such as dried meal worms.

Help your hamster forage for food
Hamsters are foragers and will spend hours digging through the bedding and searching through their cage looking for food. To avoid your hamster becoming obese and bored, scatter their daily allowance around the enclosure rather than feeding in a bowl.
Add a variety of treats to their weekly diet to keep it interesting and to provide all the essential vitamins and minerals your hamster requires.

Healthy treats for hamsters include:

 	Pasta, cooked or raw
 	A variety of fruits and vegetables including broccoli, curly kale, strawberries and grapes
 	Small amount of boiled eggs
 	Pulses and cereals
 	Fresh mealworms – one or two at a time, unless your dry food already has these included
 	Apple wood – or other fruit tree wood – to gnaw on
 	Dried herbs. There are many mixtures available from pet stores such as mountain and garden mix
 	Dog biscuits such as gravy bones

Water supplements, fatty or colourful chew sticks and mineral and salt blocks are unnecessary and can in some cases be harmful. Avoid these and stick to healthy, natural treats and food options.

How to handle your hamster
Hamsters can become easily hand-tame and enjoy coming out of their cage.
When your hamster arrives in its new home, avoid handling for a day or two to allow them to settle in. When preparing to handle your hamster, ensure they are alert and aware of your movements.
Syrian hamsters, in particular, can find a hand suddenly hovering above them when they are resting very threatening. Ideally, handle your hamsters during their active periods to reduce the stress of waking them up.

How to pick your hamster up
The best way to pick up your new hamster is to cup your hands under the hamster and gently lift them towards your body. Syrian hamsters can be gently picked up by placing one hand behind their front legs and supporting their rear end with the other. However, this should only be done once your hamster feels comfortable being picked up regularly using the cupping method.
Hamsters can make sudden movements, which could lead to injuries if they fall while you’re standing up. For the first few weeks, sit on the floor and allow your hamster to walk over each hand or sit in your lap. Socialising frightened hamsters
If your hamster is a baby or has had limited handling, they may be very nervous and have a tendency to rear up and scream at you in defence.
When you first bring your hamster home, place their cage in a room that has medium levels of movement and noise to help them get used to your sounds and movements.
The safest way to socialise your hamster is to place a short tunnel in front of them to encourage them to walk in, and let them come out to investigate you in their own time. This can be done on the floor of a secure room or in a bath.
Wear a long-sleeved jumper with some of the bedding smell on the sleeves, and use the sleeves to cover your hands. Allow your hamster to walk on to your covered hands in their own time. After a few sessions of doing this you can slowly reveal your hands and encourage them to walk across and gently stroke your hamster.
Always try to place them back in the cage whilst they are still relaxed and happy with the situation rather than when they become irritable. Otherwise this will become a learned behaviour of how to get you to leave them alone.
Once they’re happy with you, you can slowly practice picking them up from your lap and placing them back down again. After one to two weeks of this calm and patient approach, you’ll find your hamster is quite happy to be picked up, handled and hand fed.

Roborovski hamsters and handling
Unfortunately, Roborovskis are not suitable for regular handling, especially by young children, as they are exceptionally fast. Due to their size, they are also difficult to pick up. Their fast and sudden movements could result in injury to the hamster. Therefore, with this tiny breed, it’s best just to enjoy watching them rather than handling.

Transporting your hamsters
Always have a suitable pet carrier available for when you need to take your hamster to the vet or to use while you clean out their cage. To keep your hamster relaxed and happy, place some of the bedding in the base of the carrier along with a little house or tunnel. Lastly, scatter a small amount of food around the carrier for your hamster to enjoy.

How to care for your guinea pigs during the cold winter months,"Guinea pigs can be housed outdoors and indoors all year round, but when it starts getting a bit chilly, there are a couple of things to consider, especially when it comes to caring from your guinea pigs during winter. Check out our top tips below:

&nbsp;
Housing your guinea pigs outdoors

 	Guinea pigs like to snuggle up together when it’s cold. Make sure your piggy has a friend to snuggle up.
 	Guinea pigs do this in the wild too. If you are looking for a companion for your guinea pig, we have lots of single guinea pigs looking for a loving home with a significant other and we may be able to help with the introductions!
 	If you choose to keep your guinea pigs outdoors, consider moving their hutch to a sheltered or covered area like a shed or outbuilding to protect them from the wind and rain.
 	A damp hutch can cause serious health issues to your guinea pigs.
 	You can also set up your guinea pigs’ hutch and run in a large garage, as long as it isn’t used by cars or other vehicles.
 	Cover hutches with a fitted hutch cover or blankets and tarpaulin to keep the frost and wind out, particularly around the doors and windows.
 	Make sure your guinea pigs’ outside run has a cover such as tarpaulin or corrugated plastic in case of sudden showers.
 	Fill their hutch or overnight space with extra hay for them to bury themselves in and keep warm.
 	Provide plenty of warm, dry hiding places in their hutch and run such as wooden boxes, tunnels and cat carriers. For any placed in the run, ensure they provide areas that are off the cold, hard ground.
 	Fill all their hides with lots of soft hay to allow the guinea pigs areas to retreat to if the temperature is cold. You can even place towels or blankets over any hiding spaces to help provide some extra warmth.
 	During freezing weather, you can use pet safe snuggle pads to keep them warm. Wrap these in a towel and place them underneath a hiding space that they are likely to sit under.
 	Cover drinking bottles with bubble wrap to keep the water from freezing. Check bowls regularly to make sure they have not frozen over.
 	Guinea pigs are likely to spend more of their time in their cosy sleeping areas and hiding spaces over the winter months, so make sure you do daily spot cleans to remove and replace any dirty bedding. This will help your piggies to stay comfortable and warm, whilst also helping to prevent health problems.
 	Regularly health check your guinea pigs and monitor their weight. If you see any signs of them becoming unwell or not acting themselves, take them to your guinea pig friendly vet.
 	Continue to feed your guinea pigs fresh forage and vegetables daily, as it can help them to stay healthy and to fight off any colds and chills.

Housing your guinea pigs inside
Guinea pigs will be more than happy to be welcomed into your home when it’s cold outside. They can be easily accommodated and make very well-behaved house guests. Older or poorly guinea pigs in particular will benefit from living indoors over the winter. This will help them avoid the cold temperatures, as they may struggle to regulate their body temperature.

 	If you have the space, a C&amp;C cage can be set up in your home for your guinea pigs to move into during the winter months. This should still be the same size as the space they have outdoors to prevent behaviour problems.

If you’re going to bring your guinea pigs inside for the winter, make sure you wait until the weather is much warmer and a consistent temperature before moving them back out. You shouldn’t just bring your guinea pigs in for the night and put them out again during the day as they can struggle with the temperature changes.

 	Provide plenty of hiding places in their indoor enclosure, like boxes and carriers and fill with lots of hay for snug places to cuddle up.
 	Fresh forage can be grown in trays for them to graze on or you can fill trays with good quality hay and dried forage.

How to make your gerbils feel at home,"The ideal size enclosure for two to four gerbils:


 	Depth: 30cm or 1ft
 	Width: 100cm or 3ft
 	Height: 30cm or 1ft

Suitable gerbil housing available to purchase is very limited. Therefore, we recommend building your own by converting a tank. If you are looking to purchase, avoid any enclosures that have mesh shelves, as these can damage your gerbils’ feet.
Avoid three-level glass rodent tanks – a weaker gerbil may become stuck under one of the shelves when trying to dig up for air or escape.

How to build your own gerbil tank
Use either a 3ft fish tank or a glass display cabinet, laid on its back. Both need a homemade, mesh lid to ensure your gerbils receive plenty of fresh air. A fish tank lid is not suitable.
To make the lid, you will first need to construct a wooden frame, similar to a picture frame. This will either sit on the inside ledges of the tank or snugly fit over the enclosure edges. These should be well made with correct wood screws and not tied together. For larger glass cabinets, you may need to make the lid in two sections to avoid it being weak in the middle.
Once you’ve made the frame, use a staple gun to attach 1cm by 1cm welded mesh to the lid. Ideally, place this on the inside of the lid to avoid your gerbils chewing the wood.

Keep your gerbils happy and occupied
Unlike most rodents, providing toys and activities for gerbils can be rather tricky. Many items are unsuitable and may injure your gerbils. However, there are a few items that will help them stay fit and healthy.
Your gerbil will enjoy:


 	Kitchen and toilet rolls. Gerbils love these and will often chew them down and use the remains to line their nests
 	Card boxes such shoe and cereal boxes. Again, these are fun to chew and build their nests in. You will often notice your gerbils will drag these down into the depths of the bedding and cover them over
 	Apple or willow tree branches and twigs. Your gerbils can have hours of fun clambering over these and gnawing on them. This form of wood is ideal for keeping your gerbils’ teeth in good health. The fresh bark will also aid their digestive system
 	Piles of forage or meadow hay. Gerbils love to make their nest out of this once they have chewed it into smaller pieces. Add a large handful every other day, and watch them pull it down through the tunnels
 Choosing the right gerbil bedding
The wrong bedding for your gerbils can have a very negative effect on their health. Wood shavings or sawdust can be extremely harmful to your gerbils’ skin and airway, and can give you an allergic reaction too!
Again, gerbils are slightly different to other rodents. They like a deep layer of bedding in which they will build tunnels and nesting pods. Aim to fill your tank around 3⁄4 full, allowing your gerbil enough room on the surface for them to reach up on their hind legs without touching the lid.
Below are bedding materials that are safe for your gerbils’ tank:


 	Small-cut, shredded paper. Easy to use, and best of all, it’s free! Use shredded paper to line the floor
 	Finacard. A shredded card material, good for the base of the cage
 	Cardboard squares around 1 cm square, ideal for the base of the cage
 	A small handful of white, soft tissue paper bedding is suitable for your gerbils’ sleeping area. Please avoid the cotton wool type, as this can be dangerous to your gerbils
 	Organic soil – this needs careful monitoring to prevent it from drying out and becoming dusty, which could affect your gerbils’ lungs
 	Soft, green hay as nesting material a few times a week.

How to clean out your gerbil
As a gerbil house is made up of deep bedding, give then a full clean out every three to four weeks. Do a daily pick of any dirty areas and remove old food to prevent it from becoming contaminated. Your gerbils will also appreciate a top-up of nesting material, such as white tissue bedding or hay, a few times a week.
When your gerbils are due to be cleaned out, remove them from the tank and place them in a rodent pet carrier. Place some of the bedding and a toilet roll in the carrier to help them feel relaxed. Completely empty the tank and clean it with a pet-friendly disinfectant. Once dry, refill with fresh bedding and activities.         "
Poisonous food and plants for guinea pigs,"Foraging for your piggies is an organic way of feeding them, plus it’s cost-effective for you. Stinging nettles and rose petals can be dried out and given as treats later in the year, while other plants such as fruits, vegetables or soft leaves like mallow can be fed fresh on the day.
To help your guinea pigs live a long and healthy life, their diet should be as natural and varied as possible. But, there are several foods and plants that can be poisonous to them. Take a look at our list below of foods and plants to avoid:


 	Pet shop treats such as yoghurt drops, chew bars etc are very fattening and can contribute to poor dental health.
 	Avocado
 	Buttercup leaves and flowers can cause extreme discomfort and in some cases be fatal
 	Foxglove
 	Ragwort
 	Ivy
 	Privet
 	Holly
 	Yew
 	Hemlock
 	Wild garlic
 	Lords and ladies – common in damp or woody areas.
 	Any plants with bulbs
 	Nightshade
 	House plants such as the spider and rubber plant
 	Potatoes

Remember: if you go out foraging, take a plant ID or forage book with you so you don’t pick dangerous plants  Looking for more advice?

Ferrets: your day-to-day guide,"Ferrets may not be for first-time pet owners, but they certainly suit many families if cared for properly. You’ll have hours of fun and be rewarded with lots of cuddles from these cheeky little creatures.

What to feed your ferrets
Ferrets are carnivores, so they need a diet that has plenty of protein in it to help them stay fit and healthy. A good quality, complete dry ferret food will provide them with all the nutrients they need. But you can also offer your ferrets a variety of tasty treats:


 	Raw eggs
 	Tinned cat food – but only poultry or game meats. Don’t feed your ferrets fish as they can’t digest it properly
 	Boiled chicken off the bone
 	Lactol milk (a fortified milk supplement, available from supermarkets and pet shops)
 	Ferret vitamin and malt paste, a tasty vitamin supplement
 	Raw meat that has been safely and correctly obtained, e.g. chicks, pheasant and rabbit. These can be obtained from most reptile specialists and will need defrosting safely

Ferret paste is a useful tool when training your ferret or putting their harness on. It’s also very useful for distracting them during a nail clipping session.

Ferrets and water
Make sure your ferrets have access to fresh, clean water at all times. Ferrets can be quite prone to dehydration during the summer months. Try providing a shallow, children’s paddling pool or fill a cat litter tray with clean water. Your ferrets will enjoy splashing around in it and rehydrating as they play.
Ferrets can be rather mischievous when it comes to their food and water bowls. Ideally, always use heavy ceramic cat or dog bowls. Dry food can be placed in feed balls, which ferrets love. Feed balls make feeding more exciting and encourage their natural instinct to hunt and work for their food.

Handling your ferrets
Ferrets are very sociable. As well as the companionship of other ferrets, they also love to socialise with their owners. Your ferret can become very bonded and attached to you, making playtime an eagerly anticipated part of their day.
Regular handling and interactive play sessions will encourage your ferrets to form a lasting bond with you and your family. It’s always better to handle your pets when you are in a relaxed and confident frame of mind as ferrets are very sensitive and will detect tension. Excited, happy ferrets will fluff their tails up like bottle brushes and jump around your feet and legs. This is sometimes called their weasel dance. When they are tired, they’ll enjoy gentle cuddles, and they’ll snuggle up to you. How to pick up your ferrets
When going to pick up your ferrets, remember that they are short-sighted and react to sudden noises and smells. Always talk to them calmly so they are aware of you. If your ferrets are well socialised, you will be able to pick them up with one hand under their armpits and then bring them into you. Always do this calmly and confidently to avoid a sneaky nip from your cheeky ferrets.
If your ferrets are still being socialised, you can encourage them into a cat carrier rather than picking them straight up. Or use a towel to cover your hands to protect you from nips when you pick them up around the armpits.
If your ferret is wriggling lots or trying to get up to mischief, place both hands under their armpits to gently swing them side-to-side and stroke the body downward. This will relax them.

Walking your ferrets
Ferrets love to go for walks – just be prepared for some funny looks from passers-by! You will need to buy them a secure harness and a lead. Ideally, the harness will be similar to a dog harness with two sections, and will clip together. Most are adjustable and will need to be fairly tight to prevent your cheeky ferret wriggling free.
Keep a very close eye on the ferrets while you’re walking them. They may try to escape the lead as they romp in the grass. Avoid taking ferrets out into public areas if they aren’t fully socialised and tolerant of being picked up quickly or passers-by trying to stroke them.
Lastly, stay safe around dogs when out for walks. If you spot a dog approaching, always lift your ferret up – it’s impossible to know how someone else’s dog will react.         "
How to care for your cat after an operation,"If your cat has had an operation involving sedation or general anaesthetic, here’s how to best take care of them afterwards:

Control their diet

 	After the operation, feed your cat a bland cat meat for the next three meals
 	Tinned supermeat in chicken and fish flavours is higher in protein which helps your cat heal faster. It is easily digestible as  their gut motility (the passage of food moving through your cat’s digestive system) slows down during the pre-operation starvation and anaesthetic process
 	Avoid tinned jelly and gravy products as these are too rich and may cause diarrhoea.

Fit their protective collar
A Buster collar or Elizabethan collar is a protective veterinary device shaped like a cone – it is vital to prevent your cat from biting, licking or scratching at their wounds while they’re healing. Although known informally as ‘the cone of shame’, most cats adjust to them very well.


 	Always apply the protective collar if there is the possibility of your cat interfering with their wound or causing self-trauma
 	The collar should be short enough to let your cat eat and drink. If your cat won't eat or drink with the collar in place you can be temporarily remove it for meals
 	The protective collar is there for a purpose. Just a few minutes of self-trauma to a freshly healing wound can cause your cat several more days of recovery time after an operation. If your cat has tried to relieve irritation once by licking or chewing, they are likely to do so again if you take the collar off.

How to look after incision wounds

 	Look for excessive swelling or discharge from the wound
 	Keep the wound clean
 	Reaction to the suture material can cause a small amount of swelling and give your cat’s wound the appearance of being puckered. This should go away in a day or so
 	Being able to lick or chew at the wound will aggravate the healing and cause further swelling, inflammation and the possibility of infection.

Caring for stitches or sutures

 	Watch out for your cat licking or chewing at external stitches
 	Most of the sutures placed are underneath the skin layer and the material used is dissolvable
 	Non-dissolvable external suture material will be removed by your vet about 10 days after the operation
 	Having stitches in can sometimes be irritating for cats and their natural reaction is to try to scratch or chew them out. Make sure they wear their protective collar
 Make sure your cat gets plenty of rest

 	Keep your cat indoors after an anaesthetic as their coordination and ability to control their body temperature might be reduced. Speak to your vet about when it’s safe for your cat to go outside again
 	In cases of fracture repairs or surgery performed around a joint it is vital that your cat’s exercise is restricted. This usually means strict cage rest – your vet will advise you on this
 	If your cat walks and jumps around in the days following their surgery it will put excessive pressure on a recently closed wound. This could delay the healing time or even damage the wound
 	Cutting short their restricted exercise time can also cause problems. Partly healed tissue can be damaged, re-opening the wound.

Looking after their bandages

 	Keep bandages clean and dry at all times
 	Temporary bandages should be removed 48 hours after the operation, at your veterinary practice
 	Larger immobilising leg bandages used for fractures (known as Robert Jones bandage) are placed so that your cat can still walk. Check them regularly, especially if they’re on a front leg and being used in a litter tray. Even if just the tip of the bandage becomes wet, the whole thing will have to be changed – a long process which is expensive and uncomfortable for your cat

Keep an eye on your cat’s coughing

 	If your cat has a full general anaesthetic they will have an endo-tracheal tube passed down their throat. Placement and removal may cause irritation to your cat’s throat, leading to a slight cough for a day or so afterwards
 	Keep an eye out for minor coughing in the first few days after an operation or investigative procedure
 	Any minor coughs or phlegm production should still be reported to your veterinary surgery.

Your cat’s mouth after dental work

 	Look for soreness of gums, signs of discomfort, difficulty eating, and lack of appetite or excessive drooling
 	Initially your cat’s mouth will be red and inflamed but this should calm down within five to seven days. During this time, ensure that your cat is not having difficulty eating their usual diet. You may want to offer them soft mashed food if they’re too uncomfortable to eat dry biscuits.

Care after neutering

 	You will probably see some redness, swelling and bruising around your cat’s scrotum and incision wounds after the operation. The scrotum will not shrink as soon as the testicles are removed, it will take time to reduce in size
 	Look for excessive, dark purple bruising or hardened swelling
 	In a routine cat castration, it is standard procedure to allow the incision wounds to heal by themselves.

If your cat has had an operation and you’re concerned about anything, contact your vet immediately.         "
How many ferrets should you keep?,"Ferrets don’t cope well living alone and should be kept in pairs or groups. You’ll often find them having an impromptu play, charging around their enclosure and springing at each other. One thing’s for certain, they always choose to snuggle together in a big pile when they sleep.

Ferrets can be kept in same-sex pairs or a male and female. Whichever pairing you go for, you will need to have them all neutered to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

Ferrets will also happily live in groups – these can also be mixed sexes. Ferrets can be quite particular about their companions, so new pairings or new ferrets coming into a group must be introduced with care and monitored for up to two weeks.
How to introduce ferrets to each other
Always mix ferrets on neutral territory, ideally in an area that they can stay in undisturbed for one to two weeks. Ideally, introduce ferrets in the morning and when you are able to supervise for one to two days. Using their existing outdoor accommodation is possible, but it will need cleaning well with pet-friendly disinfectant and new toys and activities added to make it as different as possible.

Another way of introducing ferrets to each other is to take them out for a walk together on harnesses – again in an unfamiliar, neutral area. If they show positive signs of getting on well together, you can go on to place them in a neutral territory and let them settle.
What to do if ferrets become aggressive
Ideally, always introduce ferrets with two people there to monitor. If the mix becomes aggressive, it can be tricky to separate ferrets. Have a towel and cat carrier available to safely and quickly separate them.

Always make sure you’re wearing suitable footwear and clothing to avoid being bitten. Ferrets can become quite alert and unpredictable if they are feeling threatened by other ferrets.
How to know if your ferrets accept each other
Although ferrets usually ignore each other for the first few minutes, their first few hours together will give you some indication as to whether the mix is likely to work or not. Friendly behaviour includes:

 	The ferrets walk past one another showing no response
 	They sniff each other’s bottoms
 	They seem more interested in their surroundings than in each other
 	They play rough-and-tumble games, leaping around each other with arched backs
 	One or both will take turns to grab each other gently by the scruff of the neck and drag each other around or off to their bed area
 	They snuggle up together or feed relatively quickly.

Ferret introductions can seem very rough and aggressive, but don’t be too concerned. This is their natural way of establishing a hierarchy, and it rarely results in serious injury. Even so, it’s a good idea to check your ferrets over for wounds during their first few days together.
Signs your ferrets may not be suited
If you spot any of the unpromising behaviours below, separate the ferrets and seek advice. Unfortunately this particular mix is unlikely to work.

 	Constant neck-scruffing the same ferret in an aggressive manner, often shaking them and making them scream
 	You may spot puncture wounds around the scruff area.
 	One ferret seems to be fearful of the other after a few days – they will keep their distance and may let out a little scream or hiss when other ferrets approach.

Many ferrets bond very well with each other. Follow all the steps listed above and there’s an excellent chance your ferrets will become lifelong friends. Good luck!          "
How to make your rats feel at home,"Provide your rats with a suitable size enclosure with plenty of fun things to do to keep them fit and healthy.

Creating the right environment for your rats
When you’re choosing a location for your rat cage, make sure it’s:


 	away from windows and draughts
 	away from direct/constant sunlight, although the room will need a natural daylight source
 	safe from other pets such as cats and dogs
 	safe from young, unsupervised children
 	away for constant loud noise such as the TV or music system
 	within a family location to ensure plenty of socialising

The ideal cage design for a pair or trio of rats
When choosing a cage for two or three rats, remember these minimum sizes:


 	Depth: 80cm
 	Width: 50cm
 	Height: 80cm

The ideal cage design for a small group of up to 10 rats
If you’re planning on having a group of up to 10 rats, remember these minimum sizes:


 	Depth: 93cm
 	Width: 63cm
 	Height: 123cm without stand

Free range time
Once your rats have bonded with you and settled into a routine, you can start to allow them free range time in a rat-safe room. For example a spare bedroom with small amounts of safe furniture and activities like agility items for them to explore.
This is also a great opportunity for you to socialise with and train them. Make sure your room is free from escape possibilities, all electrical wires and plugs are protected, and remove all house plants, aerosols and air fresheners. Keep your rats happy and occupied
Rats are extremely sociable creatures. They need the company of other rats to remain happy and content. They enjoy playing rough-and-tumble games and exploring together. In more tranquil moments, they will cuddle up together. By far the most important thing you can give your rat is a suitable rat friend or two.
Rats are also scavengers – they love to forage for food and tasty treats. When feeding your rats, mix it up by scattering their daily allowance around the cage and hiding treats in toys or interesting items.
Rats love to explore and to investigate their surroundings. They are very busy little creatures, so make sure you provide them with toys and activities to keep them fit, healthy and happy.

Your rats will enjoy:

 	Pipes and tunnels for running through
 	Climbing frames like old wine racks and metal CD towers
 	Hammocks. Rats love sleeping in them, they encourage them to carry out social grooming sessions with their cage mates and feel relaxed around you. Hammocks can be purchased or homemade from old jumpers, towels and sheets
 	Ropes. These can be made by plaiting material together, or you can purchase a ready-made one.
 	Sputniks – various-sized, plastic hides that can be hung from the ceiling of the cage
 	Extra-large, solid exercise rat wheels such as a 12” Silent Spinner
 	Pea fishing – a nice activity for hot summer days. Add a shallow dish of cool water to their cage, and float some green peas in for the rats to fish out
 	Cardboard boxes, all shapes and sizes. Cut a few holes in them for added exploring fun. Old jumpers, socks and soft hats are always welcomed as bedding for your rats
 	Litter trays are ideal if you would like to litter train your rats. Use one to three corner trays or small cat litter trays placed around the cage and on different levels.
 	Dig trays. If your rats have a shallow cage base, why not give them a storage box filled with shredded paper for them to dig through and forage for food!

Choosing the right rat bedding
The wrong bedding for your rats can have a very negative effect on their health. Wood shavings or sawdust can be extremely harmful to your rats’ skin and airway, and can give you an allergic reaction too!

Bedding materials that are safe for your rat to forage or snuggle in:

 	Small-cut, shredded paper. Easy to use, and best of all, it’s free! Use shredded paper to line the floor
 	Finacard. A shredded card material, good for the base of the cage
 	Hemp bedding such as Aubiose (non-fragranced)
 	Cardboard squares around 1 cm square, ideal for the base of the cage
 	Fleece or towels can be used in sleeping areas or as hammocks.
 	Non-fragranced paper pellets, such as ‘back to nature,’ can be used to line their litter trays.

How to clean out your rats
Keeping your Rats cage clean is key to preventing serious health conditions such as respiratory problems and bumble foot – a very painful foot infection.
Clean your rats’ litter trays or toilet areas daily, wash down any soiled areas with pet disinfectant and wipe dry with kitchen roll. Carry out a full clean of the entire enclosure once a week, ensuring you also clean all toys and activities with pet-friendly disinfectant. Wash hammocks and anything else fabric in a washing machine with non- bio detergent at 60°C to kill as much of the bacteria as possible.
Take the opportunity to add a few new toys in the cage for interest, like a new tunnel, hammock or rope ladder, card boxes filled with a different substrate are also great for rats to explore.         "
Your mouse's health: what to look out for," How long do pet mice live? 
Mice are generally healthy animals and typically live between one and two years. They may be small, but like all pets, there are things to look out for as they get older. And like us, most illnesses come with age. Mice are actually more susceptible to developing tumours so it’s worth checking them regularly.

To keep them happy and healthy for as long as you can, we recommend you find a vet who specialises in small pets like mice. This will ensure they get the best possible care if they do become unwell.
Parasites and fur loss
A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another living species and thrives off their nutrients. It’s quite common for mice to carry parasites, especially fur mites. Fur mites nestle themselves between the fur which can cause some discomfort including itching, fur loss and inflammation.

Incorrect bedding is one of the most common causes of fur mites. We recommend using small-cut, shredded paper, finacard or white, soft tissue paper bedding. We would also recommend eco-friendly cardboard bedding from Ecobale.

Meanwhile, you should look out for the following signs of parasite infestation:

 	Hair loss
 	Red, irritated skin
 	Severe dandruff
 	Head tilt/ear scratching
 	Small scratches all over their body – in particular around the neck – developing into open wounds
 	Scabs on their ears and nose. These can become quite thick and look like strange growths developing.

A parasite infestation can be extremely uncomfortable, especially if it affects their neck and ears. If your mouse is showing any of these symptoms, you should consult your vet for treatment. They may need round-the-clock care to fight the infestation and ensure they’re fully healthy again. Tumours
Mice have a much faster metabolic rate compared to larger animals like dogs and also humans. Because of this, tumours can form and begin to grow very quickly. It’s fairly common for elderly mice in particular to get tumours. Mammary and intestinal tumours are the most common and are the most likely to be cancerous.

You should check your mice over for anything unusual regularly, especially when handling them. Use this opportunity to gently feel for any unusual lumps and bumps on their body and abdomen. If you have any concerns or spot something you didn’t see during the last check, take your mouse to the vet.
Old age
A mouse is considered an infant from birth to just 21 days of age. After that they’re a juvenile until they reach two months old when they reach adulthood. They enter their twilight years at 12 months old and you might start to notice a few common changes. Here are a few things to look out for:

 	Hair loss - you might notice their fur is a bit sparse or even a few bald patches
 	Becoming lethargic and sleeping more
 	Drinking more
 	Lumps and bumps appearing on the body or abdomen
 	Weight loss, but teeth remain in good condition
 	Becoming wobbly when walking about. Always keep an eye on your mouse if they’re housed in a mesh cage. Elderly mice can get caught in the bars if their nails are overgrown.

Remember, these are all very common symptoms and you might spot one or two of them. However, if you think your mice are starting to struggle with them or you notice a strange change in their behaviour, talk to you vet. It’s worth paying them a visit just to check whether they’re still healthy and comfortable and not suffering in pain.        "
What to do if your dog is possessive of food and toys,"When dogs appear to be aggressive over foods they find particularly tasty or their number one favourite toy, this is known as ‘resource guarding’. While this is all perfectly natural and normal behaviour in the dog world, it can be a problem if a dog shows this type of behaviour towards a person. Here we look at what you can do if your dog is possessive, what signs to look out for and how to stop possession aggression in dogs.

Behaviour is triggered by an individual’s emotional state. Aggression is often caused by fear and worry. That’s why it’s important to understand the emotion behind ‘guarding’ behaviours in order to successfully control the behaviour. Here are a few examples of guarding behaviours:

 	Dog growls at strangers when waking on the lead = dog is worried about strangers.
 	Dog growls at owners when he is on the sofa = dog is worried about losing his comfy spot.
 	Dog growls and snaps at owner when they approach him whilst he is eating = dog is worried his food will be taken away.


Toy guarding
Toys are a highly useful resource for all dogs. Allowing your dog to play with dogs helps keep them fit, aids training, gives them something to chew on and encourages natural behaviours. Sometimes however, certain dogs get possessive over toys with other dogs and people when they’re touched.

Remember, your dog’s reaction won’t be unprovoked and it’s best not to respond verbally or physically. This approach can only make the situation worse and could result in a bite.
Encouraging positive toy play

 	Teaching a dog the ‘take it’ or ‘leave it’ exercise is always a good place to start. If the dog is exclusively a guardian of toys, then the use of treats only for this exercise is recommended.
 	Refrain from entering the dog’s personal space in order to obtain its toy. Teaching the dog to ‘retrieve’ (take the toy to the owner) is the key to success.
 	Encourage a game of tuggy. Verbally reward the dog for pulling against you, and then suddenly let go of the toy whilst happily telling him that he is very strong and clever. Hold your hand out whilst still using a happy and praising voice and ask the dog if he wants to try his luck again. The first couple of times you might need to encourage him to come towards you, but providing you make the game of tuggy fun and exciting and let him win, the chances are that he will end up thrusting the toy in your hand to give it another go.


Guarding of stolen items
Some owners are unconsciously teaching their dogs to actively steal things! Their response to the dog running off with a stolen item is to chase after him, while commanding them to let go in a forceful way.  This will only encourage them further as the drive for a dog to steal something in the first place is generally due to boredom and/or attention seeking. The aggression problem arises for the same reason as with toy guarding – fear of punishment, and fear of losing possession of the item.

How to stop possession aggression in dogs 
The ultimate way to stop possession aggression is to make sure your dog has lots of things to keep them entertained. This can be achieved in many ways, but if you are stuck for ideas, please don’t hesitate to contact us.
What are the first steps to take? 
The first thing to do if you find your dog keeps stealing things and becoming possessive is to ask yourself the following:

 	Is the item dangerous for them to have?
 	Just how valuable is the item to you?

If you suspect the item is dangerous for your dog to have in their mouth, or it’s a precious item to you and you don’t want it destroyed,  it must be removed from the dog as quickly as possible. And here are some top tips:

 	Avoid direct confrontation. Grab some high value food such as a lump of cheese, liver, or sausage, and throw pieces of it to the dog in quick succession.
 	As the dog starts to take the food, throw a handful of the food away from the stolen item and when your dog goes to devour it, take the opportunity to safely retrieve the item while your dog is distracted.
 	Try lots of positive and encouraging verbal interaction so that you don’t frighten your dog.

Things to remember

 	Try not to trigger the fear response or use any firm language or handling.
 	Keep your tone happy and positive, as it will likely keep the dog relaxed and they’ll stay close to you. If you then need to walk towards the treat cupboard or fridge, continue to acknowledge their trophy. Chances are, your dog will follow you and then drop the item in the expectation of a reward.
 	It’s far better to have a dog that steals things who then immediately seeks out their owner to show them their prize in order to get a reward, rather than having a dog that steals things who then runs off and guards it with its life.
 Food guarding
Food guarding is typically understood, especially when a dog seems aggressive when it comes to protecting their food. Food is a valuable item for dogs, it stems from their instincts to hunt food in order to survive. For some dogs, having their dinner is the highlight of their day and having someone get in the way of that can be very distressing for them.
Signs food guarding include:

 	The dog eating faster.
 	Freezing over the bowl and staring.
 	Snapping and biting.

Recognising these signs will help you know your dog is feeling uncomfortable and when to stop your approach.
How to handle food guarding
There are relatively easy ways for you to overcome this problem,  it just requires a gentle persistent approach:

 	The first step is to ensure your dog has a healthy diet and not necessarily the tastiest.
 	The second step is to have a selection of very high value food at your disposal.
 	The final aim is when you approach your dog while it’s eating, they will lift their head to come happily out of the bowl in the hope something positive and nice will be added to it.

Top tips

 	Training should start when you’re at a suitable distance away from your dog and their food. Remember to avoid triggering a sense of fear.
 	Drop a decent sized chunk of high value food as close to their bowl as possible. The food should be thrown regardless to your dog’s response. This should be done approximately three times per meal.
 	Once your dog lifts their head from the bowl, you may then step towards the dog and throw the food. Take this nice and slowly and build progress in stages, if it’s rushed in any way, you might end up back where you started.

If you’ve successfully achieved this, you’ll know your dog is recognising good emotion when a person approaches them while eating instead of being frightened or defensive. Hopefully by this stage, you will no longer be seeing any type of aggressive behaviour.

Any form of resource guarding can be tricky to live with, but understanding how a dog is feeling at the time will go a long way. You’ll have the confidence and knowledge of how to resolve the issue.         "
How to house your ferrets,"They also sleep for an average of 16-20 hours a day. By creating a suitable home that is cosy and comfortable you can make sure your ferrets are happy, stimulated and fulfilled.

Creating the right environment for your ferrets
The ideal ferret enclosure is a converted garden shed with an aviary attached or a large wooden walk-in dog kennel and run. The area will need to be well built with welded mesh and a solid floor. This can be either concrete or wood with a carpet or vinyl covering.
Make sure your enclosure has a double-door system, stable door or a 2 feet high barrier in front of the door. This will prevent sneaky ferrets rushing out and escaping when you open the door.
An outdoor enclosure like this offers your ferrets access to lots of space and activities 24/7, which suits their random pattern of sleeping and being awake. It also maintains a natural temperature year-round – this is important as ferrets can be very sensitive to extreme heat and cold.
Whether you’re planning to buy an enclosure or build your own, carry out regular inspections on your ferrets’ accommodation to check for damage from poor weather conditions.
&nbsp;
What size should an outdoor ferret enclosure be?
The ideal outdoor enclosure size for a pair of ferrets is 2.4 metres long by 2 metres wide by 2 metres high (8 ft long by 6 ft wide by 6 ft high). Building your own: what you need to know
If you’re considering building your own ferret accommodation, it’s vital you use the right materials. Remember, this housing needs to last up to 10 years. It needs to be strong and secure to protect your ferrets from unnecessary accidents and escape attempts. Here are a few things to bear in mind before you start building:


 	Chicken wire is not suitable for animal housing. It is too weak and easy for your ferrets to damage and escape from
 	Use small gauge, strong welded mesh. The mesh should be nailed or heavy-duty stapled on to prevent the ferrets from forcing the mesh from the framework
 	Sheds and runs will need secure bolts placed on the doors, not swivel latches. Predators and young children can easily open swivel latches or flimsy bolts
 	Run lids will need to be strong enough to withhold a predator or windblown items landing on them. Ideally, make the roof in three sections with a supporting beam to aid the strength and prevent dipping in the middle
 	Cable ties are not suitable for tying run panels together. The housing must be secured with suitable wood screws
 	Plastic children’s play houses are not suitable for ferret housing
 	Tunnels or pop holes fitted between the shed and run will need to be secure and durable. Poorly made tunnels can lead to escaped ferrets!
 	Consider a waterproof roof with corrugated plastic so your ferrets' area remains dry.

&nbsp;
Can I keep ferrets indoors?
Ferrets can enjoy living indoors with their family. They will need 24hr access to a secure, ferret safe room to avoid health issues such as obesity or joint mobility problems.
Housing ferrets indoors isn’t for everyone. Once they have been neutered, their odour reduces. However, you and your visitors will still notice it. You will also need to make sure that the ferret-friendly room is free from risks such as electric cables and plug sockets, gaps out of windows or into walls, and aerosols or plug-in diffusers.

How to make your mice feel at home,"They absolutely love to climb and explore their surroundings, foraging for food and digging in bedding materials. They need a much more interesting home than a small cage with a house and wheel.

Creating the right environment for your mice
The cage you choose will need space for you to add lots of activities them to climb and explore. Your mice will also need a floor space they can do lots of running around on and bedding that they can dig and forage in.


The ideal cage design for a single or small group of mice
When choosing a cage, remember these minimum sizes:


 	Depth: 50cm
 	Width: 80cm
 	Height: 35cm
 	Bar spacing: 6mm is the safest size


Keep your mice happy and occupied
Mice are extremely energetic and agile. They enjoy running across ropes and can manage heights and angles quite well with the aid of their tail. Make sure you provide them with toys and activities to keep them fit, healthy and happy.
It doesn’t need to be expensive. Homemade items, children’s toys and even a kitchen roll tube will be much appreciated by your little pet.

Your mice will enjoy:

 	Plastic or card tunnels and tubes. Some tunnels allow you to build big mazes with them and even a loop-the-loop!
 	Card boxes such as shoe and cereal boxes
 	Children’s toys, such as mini dollhouses and early learning toys, can offer great hiding places and nesting opportunities
 	Wheels. Your mouse’s cage doesn’t need one constantly so don’t feel guilty mixing it up. Have it in some weeks, and remove it for a while during others
 	Ropes and ladders. These can be purchased or homemade. Even some dog tugger ropes are ideal!
 	Plastic houses and hides
 	Hammocks – these can be homemade or purchased
 	Apple or willow tree branches and twigs for climbing on
 
Choosing the right mouse bedding
The wrong bedding for your mice can have a very negative effect on their health. Wood shavings or sawdust can be extremely harmful to your mouse’s skin and airway, and can give you an allergic reaction too!

Below are bedding materials that are safe for your mouse to snuggle in:

 	Small-cut, shredded paper. Easy to use, and best of all, it’s free! Use shredded paper to line the floor
 	Finacard. A shredded card material, good for the base of the cage
 	Cardboard squares around 1 cm square, ideal for the base of the cage
 	White, soft tissue paper bedding is suitable for mouse bedding. Please avoid the cotton wool type, as this can be dangerous to your mice


How to clean out your mice
Keeping your mouse cage clean is key to preventing serious health conditions such as respiratory problems.
Mice, in particular males, can be very messy and will generally not choose a main toilet area. To help keep the odour at bay, use a small dustpan and brush or damp cloth to remove excessive build-ups of wee and poo daily.
Carry out a full clean of the entire enclosure once a week, ensuring you also clean all toys and activities with pet-friendly disinfectant. Take the opportunity to add a few new toys in the cage for interest, like a new apple branch or box for your mice to explore.         "
Muzzle training: your step-by-step guide," They might eat things out on walks that upsets their stomachs, they might have the unfortunate habit of eating the poo of other animals, they might be a risk to wildlife or they might be worried about the close proximity of strangers or other dogs. Another important reason for wearing a muzzle is for veterinary procedures.
Going to the vets can be a scary time for your dog, particularly if they’re in pain – it can be hard for them to understand what’s going on. Some dogs may resort to growling, snapping or biting to show they’re uncomfortable, worried or scared.
If you feel your dog may growl, snap or bite, or you’re just not sure, get your dog used to wearing a muzzle. If your vet asks you to muzzle train your dog don’t be offended – it’s to ensure the vet, your dog and you are kept safe.

How to muzzle train your dog
Most dogs don't enjoy wearing a muzzle for the first time – it can be an odd feeling and may make them even more anxious when going to the vets.
Allow plenty of time to muzzle train your dog to ensure they’re comfortable wearing it. Each dog is different, some can progress through the steps in a few days of 3 or 4 short muzzle training sessions per day. Other dogs will need to repeat each, or some steps several times before progressing. By following our step-by-step guide you will turn wearing a muzzle into a much more pleasurable experience for them and produce long-lasting results.

Step 1: Introduce the muzzle gently
If you’ve tried using a muzzle before unsuccessfully or your dog is simply worried by the sight of it, don't attempt to put it on them yet. Instead, place the muzzle on the floor and encourage them to sniff or touch it.
Every time your dog does, give them lots of praise and a tasty treat. Don’t force them to touch the muzzle. When they’re happy touching the muzzle and looking to you for a treat you can progress to the next step.

Step 2: Encourage further investigation
Place a tasty treat, such as a piece of cheese or sausage, into the muzzle and allow your dog to put their nose in it and take it straight back out. Don’t attempt to close the muzzle at this point. Once your dog gets used to putting their nose into the muzzle you can give this action the name ‘muzzle on’.

Step 3: Hold the muzzle on but don’t fasten
Place a few treats in the bottom of the muzzle. When your dog goes to put their nose in, say ‘muzzle on’, and then hold the straps behind their head for a few seconds. Release and allow them to take his nose out.
Repeat this action until your dog is relaxed with this. You may find talking to your dog and telling them they’re being good will help them feel more relaxed when you are holding the muzzle on.

Step 4: Fasten the muzzle around your dog’s neck
Work on closing the clasp of the muzzle around your dog’s neck, without their nose being in the muzzle.  Some dogs find the noise of the clasp worrying so it’s best to practice this without the the muzzle being on.

Step 5: Fasten the muzzle briefly
Repeat step 3 of this muzzle training guide, but this time close the clasp of the muzzle behind your dog’s head whilst the dogs nose is in the muzzle. Undo the clasp straight away and allow them to take their nose out. Rushing at this point will undo the good work that you’ve done so far.

Step 6: Gradually increase time in the muzzle
Slowly start to increase the length of time that you leave the muzzle on for. Remember to put your treats in the muzzle before your dog puts their nose in, keep talking to them to tell them they’re doing well. You may want to try feeding your dog tasty treats once their muzzle is clipped up. Handy hints for muzzle training

 	If your dog gets worried at any point, take a break and then start again from the previous step. You may just have been moving too quickly
 	If you’ll only be using the muzzle at the vets, put it on your dog for short periods randomly at home or when doing something enjoyable. This means your dog won’t just associate the muzzle with the dreaded vets!
 	Use a basket muzzle and not a fabric muzzle. A basket muzzle is safer for those around as it’s fully enclosed and better for your dog as they can open their mouths more fully. This means they can still eat, drink and pant, so they’re more relaxed. The gaps also allow you to pop small treats through to carry on rewarding good behaviour
 	Make sure you have the basket muzzle the right way up. The shorter length sits on top of their nose with the longer length underneath their chin.

What to do about your dog barking,"Some dogs find being left home alone very difficult to cope with. One sign that a dog is unhappy about being left is barking.
Dogs bark when they are left at home on their own for numerous reasons:


 	Boredom – being left home alone for long periods of time with nothing to do would make us look for some sort of entertainment and dogs are no different.
 	Anxiety – some dogs become so attached to their owners that when they are left home alone they start to panic. Barking and howling is your dog’s way of trying to call you back
 	Frustration – some dogs find that being able to see other dogs or even people through glass doors or windows is very frustrating; this in turn can make them bark
 	External factors – being able to see and hear things that go on in everyday life can make your dog bark, especially if they’re a guarding breed or very sound sensitive breed such as terriers or collies.

&nbsp;
How to stop your dog from barking
Giving a dog something to do whilst it is left home alone is very important. Here are some examples:


 	Pacifier toys such a kongs, activity balls and buster cubes that can be filled with food.
 	Some dogs enjoy ripping things up so giving them an old cardboard box with treats in to shred in their owners absence can also be a good idea.

For dogs that bark at things that they can see and hear, pull the curtains shut and leave the TV or radio on to drown out any external sounds that may cause your dog to bark.
In some cases, you may want to borrow a friend’s dog to see if canine companionship helps to keep your dog quiet.
&nbsp;
Training not punishment
Don’t be tempted to punish your dog for barking, this will only make matters worse. Some people have tried special muzzles on their dogs to help keep them quiet, this is not recommended as your dog could either overheat or choke to death on its own vomit if left unattended whilst wearing a muzzle.

Getting an older dog: what you need to know,"Adopting an OAP (old age puppy) is one of the most amazing things you can do. Often, people want puppies as they’re small, cute, sleepy and fun to watch grow up, but older dogs are just as sweet and fun! They’re a hidden treasure and shouldn’t be overlooked.
Contrary to the old saying ‘you can't teach an old dog new tricks’, many mature dogs enjoy reward-based training just as much as younger dogs do. Although the training won’t be as demanding, you’ll still be able to enjoy that time building a strong bond and relationship.
Older dogs don’t need as much intense exercise and are very happy with just a couple of moderate walks a day. All dogs need time and understanding when it comes to adapting to new routines, whereas many older dogs have been there, done that. Most are already very familiar with normal household practises.
Getting a dog is a big commitment, it’s important to take time over your search and never rush your decision to get a dog. Here are some tips on how to make an informed choice:

What age is considered an older dog
There are several factors that determine whether a dog is considered to be in their senior life stage or still regarded as an adult. Breed genetics has the biggest impact along with size which will broadly determine whether a type of dog is regarded as senior, or an adult.
Some dog breeds often live into their mid and late teens, while others are considered mature by just 8 – 10 years. Large breeds like the Great Dane, Rottweiler, or Mastiffs will general have a shorter lifespan compared to smaller breeds like the Toy Poodle, Chihuahua, and Jack Russells, who are often still very active well into their teens.
When looking to rehome any dog, the key is to look at the dog as a whole and not just the age in years. Take into consideration their breed, health, and years when deciding if the dog is an adult or mature.

Make sure you can give an older dog what they need
Most older dogs prefer a quieter life without the demands of a younger family environment, making them the ideal companion for those who enjoy a peaceful lifestyle. The primary needs of a senior dog are companionship, consistency in their routine and good healthcare. They don’t require as much training or exercise in comparison to puppies.

Health
Just like us, it’s more common for older dogs to experience health problems than younger dogs. For example, conditions like arthritis affects many older dogs, so they require regular check-ups at the vets to keep an eye on their overall health. Sometimes simple, low cost medications can improve their comfort, wellbeing and lifespan considerably.
Many of the larger UK rehoming charities, like Woodgreen will tell you everything you need to know about the dog’s history, including what they know about their background and any health issues. By having all this information, you’ll be able to make an informed decision about whether you will be able to provide the right care the dog needs. When considering a dog from any source, always ask to see their veterinary records, you can then talk to your own vet about any costs that may incur from any known conditions.

Insurance
It’s important to think about insurance when considering rehoming an older dog.

Diet
It’s really common for a dog’s appetite to change as they get older. If your elderly dog is fit and healthy, you might notice food becoming more important to them as they age. Just like us humans, as a dog grows older, they require slightly less calories as they are generally less active than in their younger years. This brings us to the challenge of weight gain and obesity, which is a serious medical concern in middle age and mature dogs.
Most dog foods are based on the different stages of their life. Food specifically made for older dogs is often lower in calories and many have added joint supplements too. Don’t be tempted to give your dog titbits, as these could be hiding unwanted calories. If you do find you’re treating your dog too often and they’re overweight, you could swap these titbits for healthy alternatives including carrot, cabbage and pieces of broccoli. If your dog chooses not to eat it, don’t be alarmed because that’s just their choice - they often enjoy it later once they give up asking for something tastier!
For help, seek advice from your vet on weight management, or check out our article on how to check your dog is the correct weight. Making the right decision
On top of their specific needs, you also need to think about the five main duties a dog owner has. Read our guide on what to think about before you get a dog.

Try reputable dog rehoming centres
Lots of dogs arrive at Woodgreen and like many other centres, we will match you with a dog that suits your specific needs and lifestyle. If you’ve already considered our rescue dogs, you can use the Kennel Club's 'Find a Rescue Dog' search to find other centres in the UK. You can also check for reputable centres at the Association of Dogs and Cats Homes members’ website.

Be careful online
You might see lots of pets for sale online, so be careful if you choose to go down this route. Many people are genuinely trying to find their dogs loving new homes but others unfortunately, are not. Be aware of advertisers who don’t include important information about the dog’s history or behaviour. They may very well be selling due to the dog’s behavioural issues.
If you’re going to use the internet to help you find a dog, look for websites that follow the Defra-endorsed minimum standards set by the Pet Advertising Advisory Group. These include:


 	Gumtree
 	Preloved
 	Pets4Homes
 	Friday Ads
 	VivaStreet

Visit the dog
Always request to visit the dog so that you can see where they’ve been living and how they interact with people and other animals. If they show signs of nerves or aggression, this could be a cause for concern. Observe their overall behaviour, are they friendly, active or alert?
Take a look at the dog’s overall appearance, do they look overall healthy? For example:


 	clean, clear and bright eyes
 	clean ears
 	clean, dry bottom
 	cold, clean, slightly wet nose
 	dry skin and a well-maintained flea-free coat
 	white teeth and pink gums

Always ask to see the dog’s medical records, including the vaccination certificate and flea and worming treatment record, as well as all the other paperwork to confirm the owner or seller is the right person to pass the dog to you.
Remember, you don’t have to decide to take the dog there and then. If you have concerns or have other dogs to meet before you make your decision, call us on 0300 303 9333. If you’re worried about the dog’s behaviour or anything else – we can help you work out if the dog is right for you.

We can help you make the right decision
There is never a shortage of older dogs at our rehoming centres looking for a new place to call their own, with many years of life left to enjoy.
Unfortunately, older dogs are more difficult to rehome. By offering one of our senior residents a loving new home you will be making a personal contribution to animal welfare.
If you’ve decided to give an older dog a new home, we hope we can match you with one we’re caring for. But we don’t always have the right dog for everyone who comes to see us.

How many mice should you keep?,"Mice are fascinating pets to own, you could spend hours just watching them and seeing how they spend their days. Most of the time, you’ll just find them sleeping together in a huddle, following each other as they explore their enclosure, or grooming one another. Mice really do rely on the company of others to live happy and healthy lives. When it comes to knowing how many you should keep, it all depends on their age and gender.

Here are a few things to think about before rehoming a group of mice:
Can male mice live together?
Yes, male mice can live together but it’s a bit of a lengthy process. A group of males often start out as a litter which can then be split into smaller groups. Young males can live together until they start to mature and this this point their raging hormones can lead to the odd squabble. Once you notice this friction, it’s best to separate them and have them neutered.

Once the males have been neutered and fully recovered from the procedure, they can be reunited once again as long as the mix is successful. Now the neutered males can be introduced into groups of female mice, or live as pairs.

Do mice need to be in pairs?
Mice don’t need to just live in pairs, they can live in groups, as long as they have a strong bond with their own species. They’ll tend to sleep together and maintain their enclosure and help clean each other.

A group of females can happily live together in pairs or small groups regardless. They tend to be more accepting of newcomers, including males especially if introductions are careful and gradual.
Introducing mice to each other
Before you start any introductions, make sure you thoroughly clean out the cage you plan to do the mix in. This will ensure a neutral territory with no trace of any scent from either mouse. Then you can have fun setting up with lots of interesting areas and objects for them to explore.

A few hidey-holes will offer welcome refuge, but make sure that you can easily step in to remove them if they start to squabble. Once the cage is set up, the mice can be placed in at the same time.

Usually they’ll just walk straight past each other and explore their new surroundings. It can take between one hour to two days for the mice to develop a bond. You should be able to tell if the mix is likely to work within the first hour.
Signs your mice accept each other:

 	Walking past each other with no response
 	Sniffing each other’s bottoms
 	Grooming each other’s faces
 	Taking more interest in the surroundings than each other
 	Even if the signs are encouraging, keep a close eye on them until they have settled.

Signs mice might not be suited:

 	Wagging their tails at each other
 	Seeking each other out and instantly fighting, resulting in high-pitched squeals
 	Hair pulling and wounds. Fight wounds can get infected quite easily, and you may need to take them to your vet for a check-up.
 	If this kind of behaviour persists for more than an hour, separate the mice. Unfortunately, this particular mix is not likely to work.

If you follow all the steps above, there’s an excellent chance your mice will bond and become lifelong friends.          "
Getting a kitten: what you need to know,"Whether you get your kitten from a rehoming centre such as Woodgreen, or buy from a breeder or a private home, there are general things to look out for, to ensure you bring home a healthy kitten which will live and grow with you and thrive for many years.

Getting a kitten - Where to start
Try to find out as much information as possible before meeting the kitten, as once you see the kitten it may be hard to resist. Once you are happy with the initial information you have on the kitten, if you can arrange a pre-visit with no expectations of purchase, this will take the pressure off all parties involved and will give you a little more time to make a decision.
The best scenario for any pet kitten is that it is born and raised in a home environment. This is especially important between the ages of 2-7 weeks and preferably up to 9 weeks old, when they are in their sensitive socialisation period – meaning they are the most sensitive to learning all about the world in which they live.  Being in a home environment will help them to become accustomed to the sights, sounds, smells, sensations and comings and goings that happen in a home. As long as the kitten has had appropriate experiences in this time and handled gently for short periods by a variety of people, he should not be stressed by living with you in your home in the future.  A kitten born outside or reared in a shed, an outside pen, a cattery or kept in a single room in a home, may not experience normal human home life and can become so fearful of it that they never become  comfortable living as a pet cat. If you have a dog or there is a possibility you may want to get a dog in the future, find out if the kitten has had pleasant interactions with dogs. If it has, it will be more likely to be confident around dogs in the future.

Questions to ask
A kitten should not be homed until it is at least 8 weeks old, so check the birth date of the kitten you are interested in. Ensure the kitten is eating solid food and is healthy. Find out if the kitten has health issues and has seen a vet. Ask what the health issues were and if there is a copy veterinary records available for you to see. It is important to bear in mind that some health issues may affect future insurance cover.
Ask if you will be able to see the kitten with its mother. This is very important if you are buying the kitten from a private home or a breeder. This helps to avoid kittens that have been ‘farmed’ or imported illegally without their mother and also lets you to check the mother’s health and behaviour when you visit. An unhealthy mother may not care for her kittens as well as possible or could pass on a disease or health issues to her kittens. It may also indicate that the breeder or owner has not cared for the mother as well as they should. Ask whether the mother is up to date on vaccinations, flea and worming treatment. A confident, friendly mother is more likely to raise kittens which are confident and friendly too.
Ask if the kitten is friendly. If the kitten is nervous you may decide not to go and see it or you will at least be aware that the kitten may not come immediately to you when you do visit. Ask if there is anything known about the father of the kitten.  Friendly fathers are more likely to produce friendly kittens, so this is useful extra information to have, but the father is often un-known for most non-pedigree kittens. The kitten's breed - what to do
Ask if the kitten is a specific breed and if you can see a photograph of the kitten. That way you can check if the photo of the kitten corresponds with a photo of the breed. It has been known for people to advertise a kitten being a particular breed when it isn’t.  You should also do lots of research on what specific care that breed will need. Some breeds have certain health issues, daily maintenance needs or behaviours that you will need to be aware of. Some may have inherited defects – the breeder should know what these are and if any tests to rule out these inherited defects have been carried out on the parents or even on the kitten if appropriate.
The parents of the kitten may also have had surgical procedures to correct painful or uncomfortable physical features that may have been inherited by the kitten.  If you are buying from a responsible breeder, the kitten will have been registered with GCCF (the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy), Felis Brittanica (FB) or TICA. These bodies ensure that the breeder has complied with certain rules about ethical breeding and health and which breeds they recognise and register.
The kitten should come with specific paperwork about its pedigree, including a registration certificate with a unique registration name and number.  It should also be fully vaccinated and may also be insured.  If you intend to breed from the kitten, it will need to be registered as ‘active’ with the above bodies. The breeder may have put limitations on what you can do with the kitten, including whether you can breed from it or not. If you intend to breed from your kitten, remember that you will be responsible for the health and welfare of the offspring, including any inherited problems and will be responsible for ensuring the kittens find secure and loving homes.
Even if the kitten isn’t a particular breed, ask if it is likely to be long haired. If one or both parents are long haired then the kitten may well be too. This will help you to decide if you are happy to take on the responsibility of putting in the extra time into getting the kitten used to being groomed, so that it can be groomed throughout its life without stress. Many long haired cats that have not been introduced to being groomed at a young age, can be fearful of being groomed, resulting in their fur becoming matted, which is uncomfortable and often painful. As a result, they then have to be sedated and groomed, or even shaved, throughout their lives at the vets.
When you visit the kitten, check if there are lots of other cats and kittens in the home. Large numbers of cats can increase stress amongst the cats and reduce the cats’ ability to fight disease. It may also reduce the ability of the breeder/owner to keep everything as clean as necessary to minimise the risk. The breeder/owner may also struggle to give each kitten the attention it needs.  Check if the environment is clean, including the food and water bowls, litter trays and beds.
Check the kitten looks healthy and ask if it has been treated for worms and fleas. Ask if the kitten will have any of its vaccinations, be microchipped, insured and if it will be neutered before you take it home. This will help you to work out what costs you may have to incur when you get the kitten home.
Find out what the kitten has been eating and ask if you can take a little of this home with the kitten to tide you over until you can buy some. It is important not to change a kitten’s diet suddenly – any change of diet must be gradual to avoid stomach upsets and having something stay constant as it transitions to its new home, will lessen the stress. The same applies to cat litter and the tray it has been using – try to use the same type of tray and litter when settling the kitten into your home.
By the end of your visit the kitten should have been confident and friendly towards you. If it was still nervous, then consider the type of home you are offering and whether this would be suitable for a nervous pet.

Adopting a kitten from a rehoming charity?
If you are getting your kitten from a rehoming charity, the mother may not always be around due to the circumstances in which the kittens arrived at the charity or, in some cases, the mother may have already been rehomed if the kittens are fully weaned. Most reputable rehoming charities send their kittens (with the mother if she is present) to a foster home at the earliest opportunity and will have socialisation procedures in place for the foster carer to carry out in the home.
Ask if the kittens have been with their mother or if they have been fully or partially hand – reared, as this may also have an effect on the kitten’s behaviour, especially if raised as a single hand reared kitten. A kitten that has been raised with other kittens is more likely to have learned appropriate cat behaviour, which may help it to live with other cats in the future. Also, kittens who have had the opportunity to interact and play with other kittens are less likely bite and scratch humans during play.

An introduction to guinea pigs,"One thing for sure is, they’ll fill your home with joy and excitement! Guinea pigs have lots of character, especially when it comes to food. Upon opening the fridge door, or rustling a bag, you’ll hear their adorable ‘wheek’. It’s like saying “walkies” to a dog!

Check out the facts below, they may help you decide whether guinea pigs are the right pet for you.  Fast facts
Companionship
Guinea pigs depend on the companionship of their own species to help keep them safe, happy and healthy. The best mixes are two males, two or more females, or a neutered male with one or more females.
Life expectancy 
Guinea pigs can live for six to eight years+

Accommodation 
Guinea pigs can live indoors or outside. When the weather is nice, they enjoy spending time on the grass grazing.

The ideal accommodation should consist of a five ft by two ft (153cm by 61cm) single level hutch or indoor cage and a six ft long by four ft wide by 18 inches high (182cm by 122cm) wooden framed run with a removable/hinged lid for the grass.

It’s worth noting that it can cost £300 onwards to set up an outdoor hutch and run. Find out how to house your guinea pigs.
Diet
Guinea pigs are herbivores, their diet needs to be 85% hay/grass, 5% pellets, 10% vegetables and safe plants, with round-the-clock access to fresh drinking water.

Did you know, there are lots of safe and healthy plants suitable for guinea pigs on your front doorstep? Check out our article for foraging advice. 
Health
Guinea pigs need their nails to be trimmed regularly and their teeth must be checked for dental disease. They should also be bathed up to twice a year to help prevent common skin conditions and parasites. See our article for more tips on how to health check your guinea pigs.

Family-friendly
Guinea pigs can make lovely pets for all the family, particularly older guinea pigs. This is because they’re larger and more relaxed about being handled and interacted with.

Neutering your guinea pig: what you need to know,"The best mixes are two males, two females or a neutered male with one or more females.
In most cases, only male guinea pigs are neutered. Neutering female guinea pigs can be very risky and should only be taken on by a guinea pig savvy vet if it needs doing for emergency reasons.
Unlike rabbits, neutering male guinea pigs doesn’t affect their behaviour and will not reduce fighting between a pair. Therefore, the general advice is to only neuter male guinea pigs if they cannot be paired with a male due to fighting, and need to be paired with a female.
Male guinea pigs can be neutered from 3-4 months or as soon as their testicles are visible.
&nbsp; Before and after care for your guinea pigs
Some small animal species need to be starved for a certain amount of time before an operation, guinea pigs should not be starved, and must have a constant access to fresh hay and water.
Once your guinea pigs have returned from the vets, it is very important to monitor their castrate wound for swelling or signs of infection. You should also monitor their toileting output which should be of normal amounts - if this has reduced or the poo appears smaller, then it is important to take advice from your vets straight away.
It is very important that a male is neutered and rested for up to three weeks before you pair with a female to prevent unwanted babies.

How to spot fear and anxiety in dogs,"Whether it’s encountering new people, travelling in the car or being left alone, dogs can’t tell us what’s making them nervous. That’s why it’s important to spot the signs early so you can help them overcome their fears and build their confidence.
What is anxiety?
Anxiety is a natural emotion brought on by feelings of worry or fear about things that might happen. Our dogs can develop anxiety for a number of reasons. It’s our job as owners to support them and help them find effective coping mechanisms.
What does anxiety look like?
Anxiety comes in many forms and there are different ways dogs might show their anxiety. The most common one for dogs who struggle to be left alone is by barking, howling or becoming destructive. In extreme cases, this might become uncontrollable to the point where they might cause themselves an injury.

If your dog is showing these signs when left at home alone, please contact us and we will create an individual training plan for your dog and work with you to help this issue.

Other signs of anxiety include:

 	Reluctance to eat – will your dog take food at home but not on a walk?
 	Hypervigilance/lack of ability to concentrate – does your dog struggle to listen to cues when out and about? Is he always alert, struggling to concentrate or sniffing the ground?
 	Has your dog stopped going to the toilet when out on walks?
 	Is your dog reluctant to have his lead or harness put on?
 	Does your dog bark at every little sound?
 	Do they shake or whine?
 	Is your dog panting more often, even when he’s not warm?
 	Does your dog struggle to settle down to sleep? Does he follow you from room to room?

This is by no means a definitive list of signs, but if your dog is showing one or more of these, do get in touch to chat with our experts.
How can you help your anxious dog?
Anxiety is the fear of the unknown, so keeping to a routine as much as possible will avoid any surprises that might upset your anxious dog. This is sometimes hard to do in our modern everyday lives, so having a cue for each unexpected situation can be a good compromise.

Asking your dog if he wants to do things can help him predict what’s coming next, and feel better about it. Using phrases like “Let’s put your lead on”, “Do you want to go in the car?” or “Shall we go in the garden?”, can bring a bit of predictability to our dog’s day, helping them cope with potentially stressful events.

Giving your dog some control can be a great way of empowering them, and building their confidence. Using food puzzles, Kongs, cardboard boxes or towels is a great way of keeping your dog mentally stimulated. Challenging their mind will give your dog a little win! If you’re looking for more ways of keeping your dog entertained and mentally active, read our dog enrichment article.

Teaching your dog new tricks using positive reinforcement can be a great way of building their confidence. Once your dog has a few in their repertoire, you can use these cues in situations where your dog might be anxious. If you can get him to respond you will be flooding his body with happy endorphins, banishing those fearful emotions.

Here is a selection of our favourite tricks and games:

 	Find it game - great to play with your dog while you are spending more time in your house and garden.
 	The go around trick – fun little trick to keep your dog entertained and mentally engaged.
 	The hand touch - teaching your dog a hand-touch is useful for many reasons, one of these is it’s help reassure your dog that an outstretched hand is not a threat.
 	Find my keys game – a fun scent game to introduce to your dog to help release those feel-good chemicals.

Scent games and activities
There have been lots of recent studies around scent in our dog’s lives. We can use this to our advantage with anxious dogs, as scent activities can build resilience and optimism in our pets.

Following a scent and searching for items or food actually changes the brain chemistry, releasing feel good chemicals and help tire out an anxious brain. Instead of throwing a ball repeatedly for your dog to chase (which fills his brain with activity related adrenaline) try hiding a few toys in the garden, in boxes, or around the house for him to search for with his nose.
Playing and having fun
Playing with your dog can also change their emotions for the better. Think about what kind of game your dog will like, for example, collies tend to enjoy chasing and catching games, whereas terriers might prefer chasing, grabbing and tugging. Gun dogs are likely to enjoy searching and finding games.

Playing and having fun will help your dog relax and release those positive endorphins. Some dogs however, will have to be encouraged to learn how to play.
Taking a break from walks
If your dog is anxious about going for walks, it’s okay to take some time off. Perhaps you could just play some games in the home or garden and work on some basic training or tricks.

Taking a break from the activity your dog finds scary can make future walks more positive, especially if you let your dog have some control. Let them pick the route (as long as it’s safe!) and only stay out for as long as they want. If you feel their anxiety levels rising, change the subject with find it games, trick practice or some playtime. Some dogs cope better if you stick to familiar, quiet routes, too much change and stimulation can feed into their anxiety.

If you want to change your routine, make sure you do this gradually. For example, if you try a brand-new route on your walk one day, do a familiar walk (or play in the garden) the day after. This will allow your dog to recover from the experience.
Anxiety remedies
There are a number of natural remedies available over the counter that can help your dog cope with mild anxiety, but if the level of anxiety is high, a chat with your vet may be worthwhile. Anti-anxiety medications are not designed to be given forever, but they give you a window of calm so you can teach your dog a new way to behave.

Initially, try not to expose your dog to things that frighten them. As their confidence grows, you can gradually make their world bigger as they learn to cope with things that scare them. Over-exposure to things that frighten them will hinder the progress and cause them to regress.

Many dogs and owners are living with anxiety. If you need more advice or support, please don’t hesitate to contact us.          "
How to make your guinea pigs feel at home,"A happy home is a healthy home and that goes for guinea pigs too! A guinea pig’s home should have everything they need to keep active and mentally stimulated.

Although guinea pigs aren’t naturally playful, they do like to be kept busy with toys and will love anything involving food. Here we look at all the things you can do to make your guinea pig’s house feel like a home.
Keeping your guinea pigs entertained
Guinea pigs feel safe when they have plenty of hiding spots. Here are some enrichment ideas for your guinea pig enclosure:

 	Plastic igloos or tunnels – these make great hiding spaces to help them feel safe and secure. Avoid using enclosed plastic hiding spaces such as igloos during hot weather, as they can retain the heat and cause heatstroke. Find out how to care for small pets, including guinea pigs in hot weather.
 	Cat carriers lined with newspaper and lots of hay.
 	Cardboard boxes or card tunnels – be sure to cut a few guinea pig-sized holes into the boxes to give them multiple entrances and exits.
 	Bendy stick bridges – these make good hiding spaces.
 	Some may enjoy a cosy fleece bed to snuggle in.

Making food more fun!

 	Hay kebabs and forage trees. Simply take two cardboard toilet rolls and stuff one end with their favourite hay, add some dried or fresh forage into the centre and enclose with more hay. Take a willow stick and pass through the middle of the rolls. Place several of these into an empty cardboard box to make a forage tree.
 	Forage bags. Half fill a paper bag with hay or dried grass, mix in some dried or fresh forage and give the whole bag to your piggies. Make sure you cut the handles off before placing in for them to rustle around in.
 	Stick bundles. Take 10 – 12 willow or apple sticks and tie tightly around the middle. Hang them from the sides of the run for your piggies to reach up and enjoy.
 	Plant pots. Mix some hay and dried or fresh forage into a plant pot and turn it upside down. Watch as your guinea pigs have fun trying to get to the treats.
 	Herb planters. Grow herbs such as mint or lemon balm in a plant pot and attach an upturned hanging basket over the top. Your guinea pigs will nibble the herbs while they are growing but not destroy the plant’s roots.
 	Mock hedges. These are garden hanging baskets or magazine racks completely stuffed with hay to avoid legs getting trapped. You can hang them up in the run to encourage your guinea pigs to reach up and browse.
 	Gnawing twigs. Guinea pigs love gnawing on apple tree branches and willow twigs. They love the tasty bark, plus it’s great for their tummies and keeps their teeth in good shape.

Bedding options for your guinea pigs
It’s important to make the right choices when it comes to your guinea pigs’ bedding. The wrong bedding can have a very negative effect on their health. You could have an allergic reaction too! Wood shavings, sawdust and straw often contain fur mites, cause respiratory, allergies, fungal and mange conditions.
Hay, it’s the only way!
The most suitable bedding for your guinea pigs is hay. It also makes up a large chunk of their diet, so it has multiple uses! Line their enclosure with a thick layer of newspaper and completely cover it with a good, deep layer of fresh, sweet-smelling green hay. In the wild, guinea pigs live in dense vegetation and will use this to hide from predators, so the deeper you can make the hay, the better! Be aware that some people can be allergic to hay, mistakenly thinking they are allergic to the guinea pigs themselves.

It’s often more cost-effective to purchase hay from a local farm or equine shop by the bale. You can then pick a nice, green bale and reduce the risk of being old stock and possibly contaminated or filled with sharp thistles.
Fleece bedding
Fleece bedding is an option for indoor guinea pigs, as long as they have multiple piles of hay to graze from. If you choose fleece, be prepared to sweep and wash lots of blankets in your machine as they will need changing every couple of days!
Cleaning
Daily

 	

 	

 	Pick up poo and wet hay.
 	Replace dirty bedding with fresh hay.
 	Change their water.
 	Remove any greens/forage they have not eaten from the previous day.





Weekly – full clean
This may need to be done more often throughout the winter when their time in the run is reduced.

 	

 	

 	Place guinea pigs in a secure plastic cat carrier with plenty of hay in. Put it in a safe, quiet space away from where you are cleaning.
 	Remove enrichment, bowls, bottles and clean with pet-friendly disinfectant.
 	Fully sweep out their enclosure and wipe down with pet-friendly disinfectant.
 	Set up the enclosure with fresh bedding and place enrichment back in.

How to stop your dog getting bored,"Here we look at the ways dog enrichment, activities and games can help prevent boredom.  Do dogs get bored?
The answer is yes. Just like us, dogs can get bored if they don’t have much to keep their brains engaged. Bored dogs often create their own games as a way to have fun, resulting in certain tricky behaviours.
Good news is, once you provide a worthwhile activity for your dog, they’ll happily keep themselves entertained and out of michief!
Activity toys and food
Dog enrichment comes in many different forms, including activities and food. There are lots of different ways to keep your dog busy and one of these is with food. Before dogs became domesticated they would use their nose to hunt and forage for their food, and most dogs still have a desire to do this. Many dogs get a great deal of satisfaction from food, especially if they have to use their brains to get it.  For every meal, try replacing their normal bowl with one of the following. These can also be given as an extra treat. Start off so the food is easy to get out and teach your dog how to use the toy so that they find it interesting and worthwhile from the beginning.

 	Kong – place something tasty like dried liver, ham, or cheese into the hole at the top and fill the cavity with your dog’s daily dried food that’s been soaked in water. Leave a titbit out of the opening to provide an immediate pay off and entice your dog to get stuck in.
 	Activity ball – place all your dog’s dinner in the ball for your dog to knock out.
 	Cardboard box – wrap treats in an old towel or inside a toilet roll tube and close inside a box. Your dog will love finding the treats!
 	Plastic bottle – hide treats inside these but make sure the plastic ring and lid are removed. This is best given to your dog when supervised, just in case they decide to chew the plastic.
 	Scatter feeding – throw your dog’s dinner in the garden or over the kitchen floor for him to sniff out.

How to keep your dog from getting bored when home alone
Dogs love the company of their humans and there are plenty of benefits for us too. But there are times when we may need to leave our four-legged friends home alone, whether it’s just popping out to the shops, visiting friends or going to work.

Activity toys are great for when your dog is left home alone and also useful for when your dog needs some time out or a chance to calm down if they’re over-excited. The process of playing and thinking about activity toys will help tire your dog out. We recommend the following:

 	Long lasting chews – like antlers and pigs ears.
 	Cardboard box – wrap treats in an old towel or inside a toilet roll tube and close inside a box. Your dog will love finding the treats!
 Create games for your dog
Think about what your dog was originally bred to do. For example, Terriers were bred to hunt vermin and Labradors to retrieve. Knowing this information will help you when thinking about the types of games they might like to play. Most dogs still possess the desire to perform the behaviours they were bred to do, even if they’re just a family pet. Here are some ideas your dog might enjoy:

 	Digging pit – place soil or sand in a special pit, encourage your dog over by placing treats just under the top layer. If you don’t have a garden, try a ball pool or collect some dry leaves and hide treats under them
 	Paddling pool – great in the summer if your dog likes water, also good for those who like digging if you fill it with ball pool balls
 	Play hide and seek games – start easily and place treats or toys in the same room for your dog to search out. Once he gets the idea of the game you can hide things in a different room for him to find!
 	Scent games – make an object nice and smelly, let you dog sniff it then lay a trail by dragging it along the ground so your dog can search it out and return it to you
 	Trick training – teach your dog basic commands like sit, down and paw and then see how quickly they can do them in a row. Add fun new tricks to keep it interesting.

Dog training classes
Dog training classes are a great way to get your dog’s brain working. There are many different classes to try, including:


 	Basic obedience
 	Flyball
 	Agility
 	Rally–O

Finally, remember to give your dog plenty of toys and chews to help keep them occupied. Rotate these regularly to keep them interesting and try different activities each week. Most of all, whatever you do, make it fun.

How to train your dog to use a cage,"The benefits of den training
Introduced correctly, a cage can be a very useful piece of equipment:


 	In the home for home alone training, toilet training and when non-doggy visitors come over
 	In the car for safety and security
 	On holiday to provide a home from home.

The cage must be large enough for your dog to stand up, turn around and lie down in comfortably. There should also be room for a bowl of water. If you’re buying a cage for your puppy, make sure you plan ahead and buy one they’ll fit into when they’re fully grown.

Making the cage into a den
Introduce the cage to your dog slowly and make it as attractive as possible by turning it into a ‘den’. Put in some thick comfy bedding and always have some tasty titbits on hand for encouragement and reward.
Choose a quiet position to place the cage in and cover it with a blanket. Never push your dog in and shut the door. Here is our step-by-step guide to den training:

Step 1: Introduce the den
Start by calling your dog and throwing a treat into the cage. Praise them as they move in. Repeat this several times, throwing the treat a little further into the cage until your dog has to go all the way in to eat it. You can then start to add a phrase to this such as ‘in your bed’ before you throw the treat in.
Leave the cage door open at all times and allow your dog to wander in and out when they like. If the den is inviting enough they may start to choose it as a sleeping area.

Step 2: Dinner in the den
Next, start to feed your dog their whole dinner in the cage instead of just a treat. Leave the door open the whole time. Shutting the door too soon will make them reluctant to go back in again. Step 3: Close the door during dinner
Once your dog happily walks into the cage on their own you can start closing the door while they eat and open it when they finish. Repeat this for every meal.

Step 4: Build up their time in the den
Now try feeding your dog part of their dinner in a Kong or give them a long-lasting chew to prolong the time they’re in the cage. Repeat as above, opening the door as soon as they’re finished.
By gradually building up the time they spend in the cage and using food each time, your dog will soon realise the den is a great place to be. Use the cage for no more than 4 hours at a time.

Den training hints and tips:

 	Make sure your dog has gone to the toilet before leaving them in the cage
 	Never rush your dog, complete the training at their own pace.
 	Never discipline your dog while they’re in the cage
 	Never use the cage to punish your dog. It must remain a safe, secure, happy space at all times

How to health check your cat," Here are some simple checks you can do to make sure they’re happy and healthy.

Ears
Bend your cat’s ear back gently and look inside. Make sure there isn’t a large amount of discharge or a strong smell coming from the ear.

Mouth
Gently lift up your cat’s lip folds to check their teeth and open the jaw to check their mouth. The gums and tongue should be a salmon pink colour, any redness or lumps could suggest a problem. Check the teeth for tartar, any large build up could need removing by your vet. If you notice your cat has bad breath, get them checked by your local vet.

Eyes
Check their eyes are clear, bright and free from discharge.

Nose
Check for any excessive discharge, and also for any coughing or sneezing as this could be a sign of cat flu.

Body
Check your cat’s body all over for any lumps and bumps, note if any are changing in size or shape. Look for any bald patches, irritations, soreness or scabs on the skin, check for fleas and keep an eye on any excessive scratching or nibbling.
Look out for matts in long-haired cats, or older cats who may be unable to groom.

Feet
Lift their feet up and gently check the pads for any splinters or pebbles. Keep a close eye on the length of their nails – if your cat is predominately indoors then they may struggle to maintain a short claw length.

Bottom
Keep an eye on your cat’s faeces, as an upset stomach can be a sign that your cat is unwell.
After you have given your cat a health check make sure you give them a fuss and some treats. If at any point they are not happy with being checked over then stop and try another time. How to spot if your cat is unwell
Your cat may not always clearly let you know if they’re in pain or unwell. Look out for these subtle signs:


 	Lethargic
 	Restless
 	Not eating or eating less
 	Excessive drinking
 	Keeping to themselves, not wanting to be fussed
 	Out of the ordinary behaviour

If you have any concerns about the health of your cat, consult your vet immediately.

Keep them vaccinated
Vaccinations should be given yearly by your vet and will protect your cat from potentially fatal diseases.

Worming your cat
An infestation of worms can be easily prevented with regular worming treatment. This can be quite a serious problem in kittens and cats, it also poses a small risk to you and your family. There are many types of inexpensive worming treatments that can be bought from your vet, you can easily administer these at home.

Fleas and ticks
Fleas and ticks cause discomfort as they feed on your cat’s blood – they can also encourage the spread of disease. They are usually picked up by your cat when they’re outside although they can travel into the house in many ways. Fleas and ticks can thrive in your house and furnishings due to the warm environment.
Ticks and fleas can be kept under control with many different types of regular treatment. Discuss your cat’s individual requirements with your vet.

Regular checks keep your cat healthy
Take your cat for regular check-ups at the vets for general body condition, weight and teeth. Groom them regularly to keep their coat in good condition and strengthen their bond with you – this is especially for long haired cats. Remember to keep an eye on your cat’s weight and feed them the right diet to keep their teeth healthy.        "
Your hamsters' health: what to look out for,"Hamsters may be small, but there are a lot of things to look out for to make sure they’re in tip top condition. This useful guide lists the main things you need to look out for, including parasites, tumours, and dental health.

Remember, most illnesses come with age, so until they reach two years of age, you should be able to enjoy your hamster and everything they do. With any pet, we recommend you finding a vet who specialises in a certain species, like hamsters and small mammals. This will ensure your hamster gets the best possible care should they need treatment.
What to do if your hamster is losing fur 
It’s quite common for hamsters, Syrian hamsters in particular to carry certain parasites, especially fur mites.

Incorrect bedding is one of the most common causes of fur mites. However, in some cases, your hamster may be suffering from hormonal changes or tumours, which may cause hair loss that appears to be symmetrical.

Consult your vet if your hamster is showing any of these signs of a parasite infestation:

 	Hair loss
 	Red, irritated skin
 	Severe dandruff
 	Small scratches all over their body
 	Visible lice or mites which look like orange or black dots within the fur

Wet tail
Wet tail is often brought on by stress – like change in their surroundings or the presence of another animal in your hamster’s environment. A build-up of bacteria in the cage can also cause wet tail, so regular cleaning is very important. Symptoms of wet tail include:

 	Watery diarrhoea
 	Lethargy
 	Loss of appetite &amp; sudden weight loss
 	A very strong smell of faeces

Wet tail can prove fatal within days, and unfortunately doesn’t respond well to treatment. If you suspect your hamster has wet tail, take them to your vet as soon as possible.
Tumours
Tumours are fairly common in an elderly hamster. They can grow very quickly because hamsters have a fast metabolic rate. Mammary tumours are the most common and are the most likely to be cancerous.

When you handle your hamster – and you should do this regularly – check for unusual lumps and bumps on their body. If you’re at all concerned, take your hamster to the vet. Nails and old age
As your hamster gets older, their nails will start to grow rather rapidly. Placing items like fruit tree wood for them to climb on can help file their nails down. However, your vet will be able to trim their nails if you don’t feel confident.

When your hamster reaches around two and a half years of age, you will start to notice a few common changes, including:

 	Overgrown nails
 	Hair loss, leaving sparse bald patches
 	Sleeping more
 	Drinking more
 	Lumps and bumps
 	Weight loss, but teeth remain in good condition

Becoming wobbly when walking about. Always keep an eye on your hamster if they’re housed in a mesh cage. Elderly hamsters can get caught in the bars if their nails have grown.

If you feel your hamsters are starting to struggle with one or more of these symptoms, talk to your vet. While they’re perfectly natural, you’ll want to make sure they’re comfortable and not in pain.
Dental health
Your hamster’s teeth will continually grow, so make sure you provide them with a varied diet and plenty of things they can gnaw on, including safe fruit tree twigs.

Occasionally, hamsters can suffer with overgrown incisors (the front teeth). This is more common in hamsters that have been bred poorly or have been involved in an accident where they may have fallen with an impact.

Hamsters who chew their cage bars regularly can also be at risk of dental damage so it is important to make every effort to discourage it. They easiest way is to provide a very spacious cage with lots of varied enrichment including tunnels, fruit tree twigs and toys to chew, suitably sized wheels and scatter feeding. Changing the environment regularly will also help to keep them interested.

Regularly check your hamster’s teeth to make sure they remain a good length. They should be a light yellow colour, although they can be white when they’re very young. For more information, see our article on ‘how to look after your rodent’s teeth’.

How to cope with puppy mouthing/biting,"Puppies explore the world with their mouths. Therefore, our hands, arms, legs, and clothing are all at risk of feeling those pin-sharp tiny teeth, and this can be quite scary for young children.

The good news is providing they are managed appropriately the vast majority of puppies grow out of being mouthy by around 6 months of age.
Keeping excitement levels under control
Most of the biting/mouthing occurs when a puppy gets over-excited. The key is to have plenty of toys to hand so that you can keep encouraging your pup to take their excitement out on something more appropriate.

Keeping excitement levels under control when your pup is around young children is important as they are more likely to squeal or run away from the pup once the mouthing starts, and this will just entice the puppy to do it even more. The pup may see the child as an interactive squeaky toy.

For pups that like to nibble on ankles or try to play tuggy with trouser legs, a top tip for children is for them to wear wellington boots. By doing this, the child can just stand still until the pup realises he isn’t going to get a response and move on to something else.

When it comes to your pup playing with a child, we recommend tying a soft toy onto a piece of rope so that the child can drag the toy around for the pup to chase and grab. This way, the pups teeth are well away from the child’s hands, but they can still have fun together.

You might be tempted to give a verbal warning to your puppy for using their teeth inappropriately.  However, it’s important to note that this approach is very confusing for the puppy. In his world, he isn’t aware he’s doing anything wrong, so to scare them into not doing something could be potentially very damaging for your relationship. Other reasons why a puppy might bite
Puppies also get very mouthy when they are tired. In homes with young children, there can be a lot of stimulation and therefore the pup may not be getting the rest and naps he needs. Remember - a tired pup can be a grumpy pup.

Frustration is a major reason why puppies tend to get nippy, especially the time it takes for them to become fully vaccinated. To keep them occupied consider enrichment feeding, regular short training sessions, and scent games. Once they can start going for walks things generally get a bit easier but try not to overdo it or your puppy will easily become overtired.

If you are really struggling with a nipping episode, it’s best to leave the room and give yourself a ‘time out’ so that the pup can calm down and you can find something more appropriate for him to do.

How to let your cat outside for the first time,"Allowing your cat the freedom to come and go as they please means they can express their natural behaviours. They will benefit from a stimulating and ever-changing environment outside the home, helping to keep them happy and healthy!

If you decide you’d rather keep your cat indoors where you can keep an eye on them, make sure you provide plenty of activities to keep them occupied. We recommend the following stages of play: ‘stalk, chase, catch and kill’. Feathers and wand toys are great for this as they’ll be able to channel their inner hunter.

However, if you’re all for allowing your cat to access the great outdoors, here are some things you can do to help them adjust to the outside world – and make sure they return home safely.

For any cat, it’s best to have them neutered, especially if you know they’ll be going outside. This will not only prevent unwanted litters for female cats, it will reduce the risk of disease and straying.

How to let a kitten out for the first time
For kittens, we advise keeping them safe inside until they are fully vaccinated and by the time they reach four months old.

What about for adult cats?
For adult cats, it’s best to keep them indoors for the first two to three weeks in their new home, so they can adjust to their new environment and routine. Cats tend to bond more to their environment than the people in it, so it’s important your cat is settled in your home before you let them outside to roam.

What are the steps?

 	During these first few weeks, be cautious about open doors and windows. If you have an escape artist and your cat manages to get out, there’s a chance they may not return home.
 	Try to feed your cat around the same time each day so they expect to come to you for food at those times.
 	While you’re preparing their dinner, you could make a sound for them to know it’s time for food. For example, you can call out ‘dinner’, whistle, or rattle a tin with some dry food in it.
 	This way, by the time you’re ready to let your cat out for the first time, they’ll be keen to return home for their meal when you make that familiar sound.
 	Plan ahead and check the weather. If it’s likely to be a miserable day with rain and wind, it’s best to wait for a calm day before deciding to let your cat out.
 	Choose a generally quiet day when there aren’t many comings and goings in the garden and house. If you’re throwing a house party or BBQ, it could be quite scary for your cat to be around so many people.
 	For particularly nervous cats, why not keep them company in the garden? You can also leave the back door open for them so they know they can retreat inside if things get too much for them.
 	As tempting as it may be to use a harness and lead when taking your cat out, this is something we would suggest to avoid. Cats will naturally run away to a safe place when they’re worried by something, so keeping them restrained on a lead can cause anxiety. The lead may also become caught and tangled if they do manage to run away.
 	Before you let your cat outside, make sure they are microchipped with your updated details on so they can be identified should they get lost.
 	Place a collar on your cat that has a safety release mechanism – collars without a safety release can be risky and cause injuries. It’s also worth attaching an identification tag to the collar so people know your cat is microchipped.

It can take a bit of getting used to for some cats so it’s worth trying their collar on while still indoors. Treats will help when it comes to this! They’ll soon learn a collar is a good thing and associate it with something they like. After a few trips outside, your cat will start to feel more confident in their surroundings – and you’ll feel more comfortable about letting them out. Happy exploring!

How to let your cat outside after moving?
You can follow the same steps as above when it comes to letting your cat out after moving home. You may find they settle quicker than expected and that’s because they’re used to you and their scent will already be on furniture from the previous home.

Another thing you can do is avoid washing their bedding and blankets right before you move. Having a familiar scent on these items will help your cat to feel safe and settled in the new home.          "
Puppy toilet training: what you need to know," Weeing and pooing are normal, natural and necessary. Never punish your dog for answering the call of nature - they can’t help themselves. Their body tells them to go to the toilet, so they do. Your job is to teach them the appropriate place to do it.
Know when your puppy is likely to go
There are certain times when your dog is likely to relieve themselves:

 	after sleeping
 	after eating
 	after playing

How to toilet train your puppy

 	Routinely take your puppy out into the garden after each of these activities and wait with them until they go to the toilet. As they do, introduce a word or two which mean ‘go to the toilet’. The instant they finish, give them a tasty titbit
 	If they’re too distracted sniffing plants and chasing birds, put your dog on a lead when you take them out. Then, you can let them off lead to play as a reward for relieving themselves
 	Make sure you stay with your puppy when they go out to the toilet. This is the only way to know that they’ve actually been, and to reward them at the right time
 	At other times, watch for signs they may need the toilet, such as sniffing at the door, circling or staring at you. If you’re having difficulty spotting the signs let your dog out every hour or so and work from there.

Reward but never punish
If your puppy does get caught short in the house, you should never scold them or rub their nose in it. They’ll think you’re telling them off for the act of going to the toilet, not for where they’ve done it. Next time your dog will be likely to hide behind the sofa or in a bedroom and do it there. Simply clean up and keep an eye on when they might need the loo. Puppy toilet training at night - Don’t change the routine
Many owners put newspaper or puppy pads down for their puppy at night, but this can cause a lot of confusion. You spend the day trying to teach your dog they mustn’t relieve themselves indoors but then allow him to do just that throughout the night. This can really slow learning down.

Instead of this get up and let your puppy out through the night. You only need to do this a couple of times for the first few nights. For example, for the first few nights bed them down at 11pm, get up and let them out at 2am, 4am and then get up at 7am.

After that, work out the best time to take them out and reduce the night trips to just one. This may seem more inconvenient, but it helps your dog learn much faster and saves you waking up to wee and poo covered newspapers every morning.

If you can’t let your dog out at night, follow the same training method as above, but be aware that full housetraining will take longer to achieve. Avoid putting puppy pads down throughout the day for the same reason.
Using a cage to aid toilet training
You can use a dog cage as an extremely effective housetraining tool. Dogs are clean animals and are unlikely to mess in their own beds unless they have to.

A cage can be an ideal tool to help you predict when your dog will need to go out. Take your dog outside immediately when you release them from the cage and it’s almost guaranteed they will need to go to the toilet. You should start by just leaving them in the cage for a short time – under one hour. As your dog learns, this short period can be extended.

A cage can also be used during the night, but don’t forget to get up and take your puppy out. If they’re left with no choice but to mess in their own bed, you won’t be able to use the cage in the future as they may now think being in the cage is a cue to go to the toilet.        "
Calming your dog,"There are some things to consider and address before starting to teach your dog to be calm

 	Is he having his food in an enriched way?
 	Is he having his needs to chew met- dogs of all ages need to chew not just puppies?
 	Does he have enough company?
 	Is he having enough mental stimulation?
 	Does he have somewhere safe and comfortable to rest?
 	Is he fit, healthy and pain-free? It’s surprisingly common for pain to cause a dog to react in an unruly way.
 	Is he is getting the right amount /type of exercise for his breed, and his age? Searching and seeking exercise often helps - Some breeds are much more active that others, and with some the type of exercise they have really affects how relaxed they are at home.  Very active breeds that were bred to hunt, herd, and search will find learning to relax easier if their exercise includes lots of searching and less of the more hyper chasing games. Being reactive and chasing a lot causes dogs to be more ramped when they get home and takes them longer to calm down, while dogs who engage in searching will have used their brain a bit more for that exercise activity so will be more mentally tired as well as physically exercised.

Having a look at the points above, often making some adjustments will help you be successful with teaching your dog to be calm.
Not all dogs find it easy to relax and many need help to learn being calm. By rewarding your dog for being calm, your dog will start to choose to relax and will actually enjoy being calm.
The key to increasing the time your dog spends being relaxed is to catch him being calm and then reinforce it with food. Most dogs will find food a little stimulating so this training is not done as a set session, more that you capture and reward the behaviour when he happens to be calm and relaxed. Training a default calm behaviour
You don’t at any point need to tell him to lie down, or be calm, it’s much more effective if he learns to make the choice to lie down on his own without any guidance from the trainer, this way he realises in a few repetitions that this is a rewarding and enjoyable behaviour.
When you see him relaxed approach him bend down, give him a treat and tell him he’s a good boy. You should be getting the food to his mouth before he has started to get up. It’s important that you get the timing right, we want to be rewarding the laying calmly not the getting up because you bent over him, or because he thinks, or knows you’ve got food. If he gets up or you think he knows you’ve got food just walk away and wait till he settles again. This may be a few minutes especially if he is thinking about the food you have.
It’s very helpful to have a dog that always lays down calmly when you are doing things like working on your computer, cooking dinner, on the phone, or when you stop to talk to someone and he’s in on the lead.
Start at home with the lead on, sit on a chair and wait for the dog to lay down, the first time may take a while but eventually he will settle and as soon as that happens give a treat, as you want him to stay in position you can give another treat or two. Get up and move to break up the exercise by getting him to walk, and then repeat it. You can do this in other rooms of the house and with you standing still and holding the lead. Once his default response to you stopping while holding the lead is to lay down and relax you are ready to practice this outside too. Do a few sessions in the garden or just outside the door, you need somewhere quiet to begin with, once he’s got a default down when you stop while holding the lead in these areas you can extend his learning to areas with a few distractions.
Once he’s learnt that being calm is rewarding you will see him being calmer in other environments too.  At first this training might seem a bit boring but having a dog that’s calm and relaxed in new and varied environments will be a joy to live with and many fellow dog owners will envy you.         "
How to stop your dog pulling on the lead," Training your dog not to pull requires empathy and patience.

Look at things from your dog’s point of view
Going out for a walk is the highlight of your dog’s day. And when dogs have fun, they rarely walk anywhere - they gait or trot. Also, dogs have four legs and we only have two – our walking pace is far too slow for an average sized healthy dog who’s excited about being out and about.
You don’t need to run everywhere with your dog. But increasing your walking speed a little will go a long way to making both your lives easier.
Also, smell is your dog’s primary sense. Dogs absorb the vast majority of their information via what they can smell, so their urge to pull towards different odours is incredibly strong.

Basic tips to train your dog not to pull
Once you understand these points, it’s easier to start training your dog to walk on a loose lead. Here are a few hints and tips.


 	Communicate with your dog. They need to know when they’re doing the right thing. Give your dog positive verbal feedback whenever the lead is loose to help them understand what you want from them
 	Carry high value treats. If you’re carrying delicious smelly treats such a cheese or sausage your dog will be very interested in staying close to you. Also, loose lead training can be tough for your dog to master so you need to be able to ‘pay’ them effectively for getting it right
 	Directional changes. In the early stages of training keep your dog guessing where you’re going. Try and take different routes to your destination and put in some erratic turns to keep him on their toes and interested in what you’re doing
 	Don’t pull or ‘check’ your dog. If you pull your dog back they will pull forward, it’s painful for your dog and it’s not fun for you
 	Don’t use choke or check chains. These have been proven to cause skeletal and soft tissue damage and are now deemed outdated and ineffective pieces of equipment.
 Walking aids can be very effective
No matter why you’re struggling to stop your dog pulling, walking aids can seem like miracle cures. There are two types of walking aids, head collars and body harnesses.
Head collars such as ‘Dogmatics’ or ‘Gencons’ work on a similar principle to the head collars horses wear. Dogs find it more difficult to pull against the nose strap and therefore don’t try unless there is a really big distraction. Even then the strength of their pull is nowhere near as strong as it would be if they were just wearing a collar.
It can take time for some dogs to get used to wearing something around their faces so use lots of treats and praise to get them used to it.
Body harnesses that have attachments both on the back and the front can be very effective in reducing pulling, especially in larger breeds.

An introduction to rabbits,"Often seen as cute and fluffy, rabbits come with big characters and a variety of needs. They're social animals, with the best combination being a neutered male and female pair. This means you should think carefully before taking rabbits on as pets.
Although they do not enjoy being handled, with time and patience rabbits can bond very closely with people. Then they'll often choose to hop up for a tasty treat or a chin rub hello.
If you're thinking of getting pet rabbits, we have the essential information you'll need to help make that decision a little easier.  Fast facts:
Rabbit companionship
Rabbits need to live with a neutered rabbit companion to help them feel safe and happy. The best mix is a neutered male &amp; female.

Life expectancy for rabbits
Rabbits can live for 8-12 yrs+

Accommodation for rabbits 
Rabbits need lots of space to keep them fit, healthy and happy. The ideal size is a 3m long by 2m wide by 1m high run with a 1.8m long by 0.6m wide by 0.6m high rabbit hutch or 6ft by 4ft shed, attached.

Food for rabbits 
Rabbits are herbivores. Their diet should be 85% hay/ grass, 5% pellets, 10% vegetables and safe plants, with fresh drinking water always available.

Rabbit health
Rabbits need two sets of vaccinations every year to protect them from Myxomatosis &amp; RVHD 1&amp;2. Their nails should be trimmed regularly &amp; their teeth monitored for dental disease.

Are rabbits family-friendly?
Rabbits enjoy the companionship of humans and can become very affectionate and enjoy taking tasty fresh forage from your hands.

Things to watch out for
However, rabbits do not enjoy being handled and are likely to kick and scratch if you try. They can also find loud noises and sudden movement scary. Therefore, they're often suited to families with slightly older children who are happy to allow the rabbits to settle in their own time.        "
Your gerbils' health: what to look out for,"Make sure you find a vet who has chosen to specialise in small mammals to get the best possible care for your gerbils.
Your gerbils’ life expectancy
Gerbils generally live for between three and five years.

Parasites and fur loss
Parasites such as fur mites can be fairly common in gerbils who are housed on wood shavings or sawdust. If your gerbils are showing any of these symptoms of a parasite infestation, contact your vet:


 	Hair loss
 	Red, irritated skin
 	Severe dandruff
 	Small scratches all over the body
 	Visible lice or mites, which will look like orange or black dots in their fur

Fight wounds
When gerbils start to mature they can sometimes fight with each other. This can result in potentially serious and even fatal injuries.
Health check your gerbils regularly, paying attention to their legs and face – these  are common areas for fight wounds. If you suspect your gerbil has a wound, change the bedding to towels to prevent infection.
Arrange to take your gerbil to the vet as soon as possible for antibiotics. If you are not able to get to your vet within 24 hours, clean the wound with salt water or diluted Hibiscrub to reduce the risk of infection. Tumours
Gerbils can occasionally develop tumours as they age, usually around three to five years of age. Tumors can grow very quickly because gerbils have a fast metabolic rate. Mammary tumours are the most common and are the most likely to be cancerous.
When you handle your gerbils, check for unusual lumps and bumps on their body. You may notice they have a gland under their belly, you don’t normally need to worry about this. If you’re at all concerned about lumps on your gerbils, take them to the vet.

Dental health
Your gerbils’ teeth will continually grow, so make sure you provide them with a varied diet and plenty of things they can gnaw on, including safe fruit tree twigs.
Occasionally, gerbils can suffer with overgrown incisors (the front teeth). This is more common in gerbils that have been bred poorly or have been involved in an accident where they may have fallen with an impact.
Regularly check your hamster’s teeth to make sure they remain a good length. They should be a light yellow colour, although they can be white when they’re very young.         "
How to care for your rabbits during the cold winter months,"If you’re worried about your rabbits being outside when it’s cold, you can bring them inside during the winter months.

 Bringing your rabbits indoors
You might want to bring your rabbits indoors during winter and that’s absolutely okay! It may offer you some peace of mind knowing they’re protected from frost in your cosy home and it might also benefit older or poorly rabbits. Before you choose to do this, it’s worth looking round and making sure you have the space for them to do everything they would outside. If you have a big enough garage which isn’t used for cars, you might want to move their hutch and run inside. Alternatively, you can dedicate a room or area in your home for them providing it’s a similar space to what they’re used to.
Top tips

 	Have fun with their indoor area and provide lots of activities for them to enjoy during the winter.
 	Place several grazing trays around for them filled with quality hay and dried forage.
 	If you have wooden flooring, tiles or any other slippery surfaces, it’s worth placing down a non-slip carpet or mats to prevent injuries.
 	Keep any toxic plants, chemicals or wires out of reach from inquisitive rabbits.
 	You might want to protect your furniture including your sofa with sheets, rabbits love chewing anything. It’s also worth bearing in mind your bunnies may have toilet accidents on the floor if they’re not used to new environments. Rabbits can be litter trained, just make sure you have plenty of litters trays filled with hay in each room to help them.
 	Whatever room or area you choose to keep your rabbits, make sure the heating is off or set to low. Dry heat from a radiator can cause health issues.

How to groom your dog,"Grooming varies from breed to breed – some dogs require daily brushing and combing, others less often. Some breeds may also need professional grooming, this can be as often as every six weeks or as little as twice a year.
Grooming is a great way to bond with your dog. It also gives you the opportunity to keep an eye out for any new lumps and bumps that may need to be checked by a vet
There are five different types of dog coat – long, non-shedding, silky, wiry or smooth. There are also hairless breeds and breeds that have coats twisted into cords.

Dogs with long coats
Long coats need a lot of attention and grooming on a daily basis. Dogs with this type of coat include German Shepherds, Old English Sheepdogs, Newfoundlands and Golden Retrievers.

Non-shedding dogs
Although a non-shedding coat will not moult, it will need to be clipped on a regular basis. Your dog may also need their ears plucked, and any excess hair removed. If they are groomed professionally this will be done for you. Examples of non-shedding dogs are Poodles, Bichon Frises and Bedlington Terriers. Silky-haired dogs
Silky coats need a lot of care as the dead hair needs to be removed to prevent it from becoming matted and uncomfortable. Examples of silky haired dogs are Afghans, Yorkshire Terriers, Spaniels, Setters and Pekingese.

Wiry coats
Dogs with wiry coats, such as terrier breeds, can be hand stripped, usually twice a year, or clipped regularly. It can be very time consuming and take up to five hours so your dog will have to be trained from an early age. These types of dogs should also have their coats combed on a regular basis to prevent matting.

Dogs with smooth coats

When taking your new rats home, allow them to settle for a day or two before regular handling and time out of the cage. New owners and environments can be very intimidating for a rat, possibly resulting in a bite.
Rats can find a hand suddenly hovering above them when they are resting very threatening, so make sure you respect your rats’ territory.

How to pick your rats up
When handling your rats, ensure they are alert and aware of your movements. Gently but confidently, place one hand behind their front legs. Once lifted, support the rear end with the other hand, and place the rat into your arms.
Never try to pick rats up by their tail – this can result in damage or even loss of the tail. Let them come to you
Your rats will find it more enjoyable and relaxing to climb and sit on your arms and shoulders rather than being held. Young rats or adults who have bonded with their owner are often very inquisitive and will come to the door of the cage or stand on the edge of their hammocks, ready for you.
Placing your arm out for them to climb on is more relaxing for them than being picked up. If your rat is a little timid, encourage them to walk into a tunnel. Carefully place the tunnel on your lap, and allow them to climb onto you in their own time. Offer small tasty treats during this time to help to build a bond.

Wear cosy clothing
Wearing a baggy hoody or a dressing gown during free-range time is always popular with rats. They can sit and snuggle with you once they have had enough of exploring – or use you as a safe space to return to if they’re not as confident at exploring.         "
What should I feed my dog?,"You could choose:


 	Complete dry foods
 	Tinned complete wet foods
 	A mix of tinned wet and dry
 	Complete raw diets
 	Home produced diets

You should choose the one that best suits your dog and your lifestyle. More important than this is choosing the right life stage diet for your dog, and the right amount of food for them at that life stage.

What to feed puppies
Puppies and young dogs need more calories while they’re growing. There are many puppy or growth diets available, specifically designed to meet a growing puppy’s needs. Find a diet that meets the needs of your puppy at this important stage of their development.
Also try to find a food which best matches your puppy’s growth rate. For example, very large breeds have more growing to do and mature much slower than very small breeds. The amount of calories they need can be very different even if they’re the same age. Large breeds need to stay on a specialised growth diet for longer than small breeds.
For dried diets the size of the pieces of food or kibble is different too. Large dogs need bigger chunks to crunch and smaller dogs are better with pieces that suit their smaller mouths and teeth.
How often should I feed my puppy?
The recommended meals per day for a puppy are:


 	Aged 6 to 12 weeks: four meals daily
 	Aged 12 to 24 weeks: three meals daily
 	Aged 24 weeks and onwards: two meals daily

Never feed puppies milk or other dairy products. They can’t digest them properly and are likely to get diarrhoea. Puppies have no need for milk once they have left their mother.

The right diet for adult dogs
When your dog reaches adulthood they can have their meals reduced to two per day. You can feed them more smaller meals, but most owners find two regular meal times easier to maintain. One meal a day is not enough and can cause your dog’s blood sugar to drop.
If you have a breed that’s been bred to work like a springer spaniel or a border collie, this doesn’t mean you should feed it a food designed for a working dog. No matter what their breeding, a pet dog is not a working dog. Foods designed for working dogs are equivalent to a diet designed for a human athlete. Your active adult pet dog will be happier, fitter, healthier and more settled on a normal adult life stage diet.
If you have to change your dog’s diet, do so over a few days. Gradually introduce the new food and reduce the old – this will minimise their risk of a stomach upset.

How to feed elderly dogs
Mature dogs need less calories than younger dogs. Many of the diets specially designed for them contain ingredients that help the function of vital organs and reduce and prevent symptoms associated with old age like stiffness.
If your elderly dog is showing any signs of discomfort it’s important to get them checked over by your vet. Just like us, as dogs age it’s common for them to experience pain that could be relieved with medication.

How to choose good quality dog food
The quality of dog food is often reflected in the price, but there are good quality mid-price foods available. The most important thing you can do is look at the list of ingredients and bear in mind the following:


 	The meat source should always be first on the list of ingredients
 	Meat is better quality than meat meal
 	Stay away from foods that list cereals before any meat content
 	Ingredients are always listed in order of quantity within the food
 	Foods with high levels of colourings and preservatives should be avoided

Good quality commercially produced diets give you confidence that you’re providing a balanced diet. If you decide you would like to prepare a home-cooked diet for your dog, it’s important to do lots of learning and nutritional research first.

How much should I feed my dog?
Most foods have instructions based on the weight of your dog - if you don’t know your dog’s weight your vet can weigh them. Many vet surgeries provide this service free to help owners keep their dogs fit and healthy.
It’s sadly common for dogs to be overweight and obese, this seriously reduces their life expectancy and their quality of life. Managing your dog’s weight is one of the best thing you can do for them. Think about how to feed your dog
It’s very important for your dog’s health and wellbeing that their food is delivered in an interesting and rewarding way. Feeding food from a bowl is only suitable for sick or elderly dogs.
Most dog breeds were developed for a purpose like guarding, herding or hunting. As pet dogs don’t usually do these activities any more, they have no constructive outlet for their biological behaviour patterns. If we don’t give them interesting activities they often develop unwanted and sometimes dangerous behavioural habits.
Making feeding more rewarding for your dog can lead to really positive behavioural changes and be the first step to preventing or solving problem behaviour.
Dogs are very clever animals and like to use their brain, they find food much more enjoyable if they have to work for it. Even dogs with poor appetites usually improve when their food is delivered in a more interesting and challenging way.
Below are a few ideas on how to make feeding more interesting, you can also watch our feeding activities video. Think about your own ideas, there are so many ways to feed your dog in a rewarding way.

Rewarding feeders you can buy
There are commercially produced products that enable you to place the food in and the dog works to get it out.


 	There are many ball feeders, some can be set with time delays
 	Stuffed Kongs are excellent for meal times and other situations. They provide an all-important chewing opportunity, and can calm puppies down in the evening after their mad 10 minutes. They’re also ideal if you leave your dog home alone
 	Puzzle feeders help dogs concentrate and use their brains to work it out.

Cost-free rewarding feeding

 	Scatter feeding is probably the easiest way to make feeding more interesting, especially if you have a garden with grass or paving. After a few sessions where you stand with your dog and sprinkle the food on the ground, you can quickly progress to scattering it far and wide and letting them out to find it
 	Plastic drink bottles are great for feeding with dried food. Remove the lid and plastic seal then pop the food in the bottle. Your dog can then paw it around the room or garden, pick it up and even throw it around. Bull breeds often really enjoy this. At first your dog may need a little help, but they will soon grow to love this game
 	A snuffle mat is a rubber mat with holes, you cut strips of fleece and thread them through the holes. Once it’s made you scatter the food in the maze of fleece strips and let dog to snuffle out their meal
 	A homemade wooden three bottle feeder appeals to taller dogs who like to use their feet or nose to spin the bottles and release the food. This suits calmer dogs who like problem solving – boisterous dogs might knock this one over, they prefer bottles on the floor
 	Cardboard boxes containing food that’s wrapped in newspaper is interesting for dogs to solve – you can also use cardboard tubes
 	Balls in a paddling pool. Scatter the food amongst the balls and let your dog get in and seek it out.

Why is my dog barking and lunging at other dogs?," Most dogs are very social and love to explore new areas and some enjoy meeting others.

Socialising dogs from a young age is vital, when they should be experiencing different sights and sounds. This is a big step in helping them grow in confidence, once you achieve this, they’ll stand a good chance of being sociable.

Allowing your dog to meet as many new encounters will help them communicate with others, and read their body language and learn whether they’re too much to handle.

Types of negative behaviours
Examples of less desirable behaviours may include:

 	Barking
 	Lunging
 	Overly physical and intimidating play
 	Growling, snapping and/or fighting
 	Mounting

&nbsp;
Why is my dog lunging and barking?
Health
If your dog is displaying any of these behaviours, you should arrange to see your vet as there may be a physical cause for the behaviour. It’s common for dogs to react this way if they’re in pain, it’s their way of warning others to back off to protect themselves from further harm. Even if you can’t see a visible cause of pain, it’s always best to double-check in the hope to resolve the issue effectively.
Anxiety and stress
If the behaviour isn’t linked to a physical cause, next it’s time to consider other reasons for the behaviour that concerns you. Many dogs are anxious about interactions with others as they didn’t get appropriate social experiences. For instance, perhaps they have encountered a dog who frightened or attacked them. Spotting the signs of anxiety and the root cause of this stress will help your pet overcome this early on and build their confidence.

Another reason might be that they are highly sociable and enjoy playing with dogs, so if they’re on a lead and spot another dog, this causes over-excitement, resulting in frustration which is expressed as barking.

&nbsp;
What to do if your dog is lunging and barking
Whether your dog is afraid of others and cowers away, or gets too excited which causes fear, improvements can be made to improve their behaviour and mental wellbeing.

 	Always consider the emotional state of your canine companion when out and about. He or she can only learn if they are calm and not in a distressed state or jumping around in excitement. If you’re ever concerned, increase the distance between you and the other dog so they’re not distracted.
 	Don’t test their behaviour, always build for success and stick to the training plan.
 	Take charge but in a gentle way and always be positive. This will put you both in the best mood for a successful training session. If you don’t see much progression, go back and repeat previous steps in the training for a few more sessions before moving forward again.
 	Always consider safety. Keep your dog on a lead and walk or train them where others are also on lead and under control.
 	Consider muzzle training your dog. This is essential if he or she has already instigated fights.

The video at the beginning of this article explains the important steps of training when out on walks. It’s important to remember that all dogs are different and some will take much longer, while others may pick it up quicker.

Introduction to ferrets,"Ferrets may not be for first time pet owners, but they certainly suit many families if cared for properly. You will have hours of fun and be rewarded with lots of cuddles from these cheeky little creatures.

There are many things to consider when taking on ferrets, these fast facts will provide you with some basic information to help you decide if mischievous ferrets are for you.  Companionship
Ferrets should live in a minimum of a neutered pair or in neutered small groups. They are predators so should not be housed alongside small pets such as rodents or rabbits.
Life expectancy
Ferrets can live up to 10 years.
Accommodation
Ferrets need lots of space to keep them fit, healthy and happy. They can live indoors or outdoors, each comes with its different requirements. The ideal size accommodation is:
Outdoors
A 8ft long by 8ft wide by 6ft high (243cm by 243cm by 182cm) aviary/ run with an insulated sleep area.
Indoors
24hr access to a ferret safe, escape proof room measuring at least 8ft long by 6ft wide by 6ft high.
Diet
Ferrets are carnivores, they require a good quality dry complete biscuit with a few healthy treats for variety.
Health
Ferrets require a yearly vaccination against K9 distemper. They also should be given preventative flea treatment every three months. Ferrets nails can grow very sharp and will require clipping every 6-12 weeks.
Ferrets are family friendly
Ferrets can make very affectionate and loyal pets; however, they may not suit first time pet owners or families with young children due to their very playful nature which can result in a few small nips when playing with toys etc.        "
Your degu's health: what to look out for,"Make sure you find a degu-friendly vet who has experience with them – and be prepared for unexpected vet bills if you don’t have insurance.

Your degus’ life expectancy
Degus generally live for between five and eight years old.

Dental health
Degus can be prone to dental problems. Unless they have inherited them from their parents, dental problems are usually due to a poor diet or even an inappropriate environment.
You will only be able to easily see your degus’ front set of teeth, known as the incisors. These should be dark orange in colour. The top and bottom set should meet nicely, be level and not at an angle.
If you spot any of these signs, your degu could have dental problems. Contact your vet if you have any concerns:


 	One or both eyes weeping
 	Drooling
 	Playing with food but not eating it completely
 	Teeth become lighter in colour
 	Teeth appear to be growing apart or at an angle
 	Face appears swollen or abscess appears along jaw line
 	Reduced faeces or size reduced
 Diabetes
Degus can be prone to diabetes – especially if they’ve been fed an unsuitable diet including sugary treats like fruits and chew bars. It can be managed by improving their diet, but it’s likely their health will decline slowly. Signs to look out for include:


 	Cataracts
 	Excessive drinking
 	Excessive urinating
 	Unexpected weight gain, appearance of obesity

If you suspect your degu has developed diabetes, arrange a vet check and review their diet quality.

Leg and tail injuries
Degus love to explore and move quickly. However, if the environment is not safe for them, they can get seriously injured.
Furnish your degus’ cage with fun activities to keep them occupied. Avoid any items that could trap their legs or they could become tangled up in. If you notice any change in your degus’ movements or swellings in their legs, talk to your vet.
Tail injuries or loss is also common if your degus are handled incorrectly or have been involved in a fight with another degu. Also known as ‘degloving,’ this is when a degu allows their tail to detach to escape a predator. Either the skin and fur will detach from the tailbone or the whole tail may come off.
Because of this, make sure you avoid picking your degu up by the tail. If your degu does deglove, they will need immediate veterinary treatment to clean and repair the wound.         "
What to do if you find a stray cat,"A stray domestic cat can be friendly, or nervous and timid. If a cat you haven’t seen before turns up in your garden it doesn’t always mean they’re a stray: they could be new to the neighbourhood, or their owners could be on holiday.

If the cat isn’t there all the time, it may be going back home. Most cats like to roam and some will wander over large areas, especially if they’re un-neutered Tom cats looking for a mate.
What should you do if you think you’ve found a stray cat:

 	Take the cat to your nearest vet to check for a microchip, free of charge. This is the quickest way to find an owner.
 	Ask around your neighbourhood to see if you can find the owner. Not all owned cats wear collars because they’re microchipped.
 	Don’t feed a stray cat just in case they have an owner, they may return back home on their own. Even if they look skinny and frail, this may be due to an underlying illness that the owner is aware of.
 	Report the cat to your local animal welfare charities, and list on an animal reunite website to give them the best chance of being reunited with their owner.
 	Place “found” posters around your local area, adding a full description and photo where possible.
 	If the cat is sick or injured immediately contact the
 	Stray cats can often have worms or
 	If you have no luck finding an owner, report the cat you have found to Animal Search
 	Download and print this paper collar to make contact with their owner, if they have one.

Feral cats
It’s easy to mistake feral cats for someone’s pet. But in reality, they may well be self-sufficient and lack human contact. Female cats can reproduce at five months old so the colony can quickly outgrow the area they are in.

Feral cats are not stray cats, they will not be friendly. They’ll run away if you approach them and their body language will indicate they’re wary. If you think a cat is feral, complete our ‘Give up a cat’ form, choosing one of the ‘stray’ options as the reason to give up the pet. There are organisations that can trap, neuter and then release the cats back into the area where they were caught. This will stop the colony from growing.
If you find mums and kittens

 	Ask around the neighbourhood to make sure the mum and kittens aren’t owned.
 	If you can’t find an owner, make sure they’re all healthy and well. If you’re unsure, ask us or your local vet for more information.
 	Make sure mum isn’t feral before doing anything with the kittens. If it’s necessary to move the kittens, it’s important mum is happy for you to do so.
 	Make sure the kittens are more than a week old before moving them.
 	Make sure they’re in a safe environment in which they can’t get hurt. If they can be moved to an outside garage or shed, this would be ideal as this can be a good way to keep them sheltered and safe.
 	Don’t feed the mum or kittens cows’ milk, as cats are lactose intolerant. Kittens should be feeding off mum; mum will need kitten meat, biscuits and water.
 	If the kittens are too young to eat meat but aren’t feeding from mum, contact your local vet for kitten milk supplements and advice on how to feed them.
 	If you are concerned and would like more information please contact Woodgreen on 0300 303 9333

If you have read and checked the above information thoroughly, you can apply to rehome the cat with us
If you find a deceased cat
This can be distressing, but it’s important that owners find out what has happened to their cat. Here’s what to do:

 	If you are willing and able to safely pick up the cat, you can take it to a local vet who will check for a microchip and help identify the owner.
 	Contact your local council to report the cat.
 	Contact National Highways to report the cat to be collected.

What to do if your dog is nervous of strangers," Your dog looks to you for guidance, so here’s what you can do to help them relax around new people.
Remember, always let your dog approach people in their own time; never force them to meet anybody. Give them the freedom to move away if they want to.

Passing people on walks
Always ensure that you give your dog enough space - this may mean arching around a passerby, or even crossing the road if your dog is worried. Explain to your dog that people are approaching by saying “there’s a stranger coming, can you see the stranger?”. This not only gives them the information they need but also gives them something else to focus on. Follow this by rewarding them with a tasty treat, and  praising them for walking past.
This should be done in a light hearted manner and with a loose lead if possible. If the lead is tight it will signal to your dog that they’re right to be concerned – this will make them more anxious.
Tasty treats or a favourite toy can help change your dog's perception of strangers. Offer these as a reward for passing people confidently or as a distraction when you they seem scared. This will help your dog to associate walking past people as a rewarding event rather than a scary one.

Meeting people outside
Arrange to bump into friends or family on a walk and ask them to ignore your dog. Make yourself appealing by having lots of treats or their favourite toy to hand. Not everybody likes dogs so it’s good training to teach them to always give you attention in the company of others.
As your friend approaches, give or drop the treats on the ground for your dog to search for – or gently throw them the toy. Repeat this several times, building up as many different people and locations as you can.
If you stop to talk to your friend they should ignore your dog but engage with you. You can then concentrate on the dog and regularly reward him for staying calm. This exercise can be built up until you’re able to hold a conversation while your dog is calm and relaxed.
If your dog looks worried, then have shorter meetings at a bigger distance. Only progress the training when they are totally relaxed and calm. Introductions at home
Baby gates or dog crates can be helpful in the home. The thought of confining your dog can seem harsh and unnecessary, but it can ultimately give them a safe, comfortable area to lie in and enjoy some peace and quiet.
This means your dog can observe visitors to the home from their safe place. Once your visitors have settled and your dog is calm and relaxed you can let them out to investigate. Give your dog a tasty chew while your visitor is there. Dogs quickly learn that the arrival of visitor means treat time, and this creates a positive association.
As with meeting people out on walks, not all visitors want your dog’s attention, so make sure you’re the one giving them delicious rewards and chews.
Your visitor should wait for your dog to approach them rather than the other way around. Make sure your dog always has a way of getting back to their safe place and visitors know not to approach them there.
It’s a good idea to pop your dog back into his safe place as your visitor leaves – dogs often stand near doors so it's best they don’t have to move the dog to get out. Again, give your dog a treat at this point so they realise that having visitors is fun and rewarding.        "
Cat FIV: what you need to know,"The virus only affects cats, so there’s no risk of infection for people or other species in contact with FIV positive cats.
An FIV-positive cat will remain infected with the virus for life. After a period that may last several years, the virus may damage the cat's immune response and lead to signs of disease. Infected cats who receive supportive medical care, a good diet and are kept in a stress-free environment can live comfortable lives with a normal lifespan.

How is FIV passed on?
Once a cat has contracted FIV it is capable of transmitting the disease to other cats. FIV is mainly passed from cat to cat through bite wounds during fights or through mating. Another, less common mode of transmission is from an FIV-infected mother cat to her kittens.

What are the signs of FIV?

 	Initial, or first-stage, symptoms include loss of appetite, fever, lethargy, diarrhoea, swollen lymph nodes and low white blood cell count. Cats infected with FIV start to become listless, don’t groom themselves properly and are prone to other infections
 	Second-stage cats may recover and show no symptoms, yet become lifelong carriers
 	Third-stage cats experience changes in appetite, toileting changes, weight loss, smelly, sore mouths, drooling, poor coat through lack of grooming and secondary infections, which become more frequent and resistant to treatment.

How is it diagnosed?
Your vet can diagnose whether your cat has the FIV infection using a blood test. How to care for a cat with FIV
FIV treatment focuses mainly on extending the symptom-free period or, if symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects and infections of the virus.


 	Assess your cats outdoor environment. If you are in a rural location with no other cats in a 5 mile radius, then continue to allow your cat full access outside. In a high cat populated area, keep your cat indoors, with appropriate enrichment and ideally with access to an enclosed garden or outside run. This will protect them from catching diseases from other cats as they have a lower immunity. By restricting your cats access to roam, you’re also protecting the uninfected cats in your community.
 	Monitor your cat’s health and behaviour. Cats especially are very good at hiding signs of ill health. Speak to your vet about any concerns you have
 	It’s not known if blood sucking parasites such as fleas can spread infection so it’s wise to maintain a regular flea control programme
 	Take your cat to your vet at least twice a year for a checkup.

Things to remember when living with an FIV cat

 	Your windows will usually need to be kept shut or have protective mesh over them
 	Your cat will need a stimulating environment with plenty of activities to maintain a happy life indoors
 	Your cat will need regular vet checks more often than a cat that has not been infected with FIV, so you’ll have higher vet costs
 	You need to ensure your cat is kept away from other cats that don’t have FIV
 	FIV cats have a compromised immunity, so any wounds or ill health will need urgent veterinary treatment.

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with FIV
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new cat and ask for more details on how his particular case of FIV has been treated.  You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any cat who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential ongoing costs with your vet.         "
Is my dog suffering from separation anxiety?,"Any breed or type of dog can suffer from separation anxiety, but neutered males, Gundogs and dogs that have spent time in rehoming centres are all more likely to struggle when left alone.
What behaviours are linked to separation anxiety?
Typical behaviours include:

 	Pacing
 	Panting
 	Barking
 	Destruction (from mild chewing to severe damage to property)
 	Howling
 	Salivating
 	Toileting (loss of bowel control) - this is often more than just needing to “go”.

Some dogs exhibit these behaviours because they are bored, or would just rather be with their owners, but when displaying this behaviour, some dogs are feeling genuine panic and fear because they are on their own. It can be difficult to know which type of dog you have, but a good way to see what is going on while you are out, is to set up a video camera and record what your dog gets up to.

If your dog is bored, you are likely to see them mooching about, chewing possessions you have left out, or they may even raid the bin. These are all symptoms of them looking for ways to entertain themselves. Dogs with true separation anxiety tend to panic. They will focus on the doors or windows, pulling down curtains or ripping up the carpet in an attempt to escape. They will bark and howl, often without stopping. If you have one of these dogs, please contact us for advice.
Ways to reduce dog separation anxiety
There are steps you can take to reduce the chances of your dog developing anxiety at being left. If your dog is one of those who is just bored, or would rather be with you, these tips should help them too.
Exercise and training
Exercise your dog before you leave them. Make sure you do this at least 30 minutes before you go, so they has a chance to calm down after their exercise. Avoid playing over-exciting games such as fetch, as this will only hype them up more and your dog will find it harder to settle. It’s much better to have a calm sniffing and exploring walk.

Do a short, mentally challenging training session. For dogs that struggle to be apart from you, this should include some stays with distance and self-control exercises like leave and wait.
Treats and activity boxes
Provide your dog with a tasty stuffed Kong or similar - you can give this to them just before you leave. Please note, if your dog does not eat while you are away, this is a sign that they are not coping.

If you have a puppy, gently and gradually introduce them to the idea of being alone. As you go about your day, sprinkle a small amount of treats on the floor and shut the door behind you. Be sure to return before the puppy has finished finding all the treats. This is a great “soft” way to introduce short absences.

You can also use feeding toys and enrichment to reward your puppy for being in another room. Similar to children, puppies develop independence by having a secure attachment to their owners, so please don’t follow advice to allow your puppy to “cry it out”, as this sets the puppy up for being anxious when alone as an adult.
Avoid crating an anxious dog
We do not recommend the use of crates for dogs that suffer from separation related behaviour problems. Crating an already stressed dog will not help calm them, and actually they could cause themselves an injury as they try to escape. Crates do not teach your dog to cope being alone, and add an additional stressor of being confined to an already upsetting situation.

If your dog is very stressed by your absence, it is unlikely that the above will make a difference. These dogs need a personalised training plan and may need some medication from the vet to help them cope with the panic they feel when alone.          "
Help your puppy socialise and grow,"You should help them experience different sights, sounds and handling from a very early age, so they grow into a friendly, confident adult dog.

Interacting with people
Let strangers say hello and fuss your puppy. If they’re a little worried, get strangers to give your puppy a treat before giving them a fuss.
Don’t force your puppy to meet people, and don’t let strangers pick them up before letting your puppy approach them first.
During socialisation, your puppy should have opportunities to meet adults and children, as well as people wearing different types of clothing and uniforms and people behaving in different ways.

Interacting with dogs and other animals
Let your puppy say hello to other dogs in the street. If they’re a little worried don’t force them, but give them encouragement and praise when they have met a dog nicely.
Don’t panic if a dog growls at them. This is a good way for your puppy to learn when they are being too much for another dog.
Help your puppy to meet dogs that are smaller and larger than them – as well as ducks, livestock, horses and cats.
Remember, training classes can be an excellent place for your dog to be habituated to people and other dogs. Book your place on a Woodgreen training class here. Handling your puppy
Every day, make it a positive experience for your puppy to be handled. Gently stroke your puppy all over. Buy a brush and groom your puppy on a daily basis so they’re used to being handled. Get them used to you picking up their feet, lifting their tail, looking in their ears and holding onto the scruff of their neck. Get them used to their lead or harness by taking them for walks around the house or garden.

Introducing new experiences
Introduce your puppy to new experiences and situations so they become confident and happy wherever you take them.
Let your puppy experience noises inside and outside of the house including washing machines, vacuum cleaners, traffic, construction, aeroplanes, music and children playing. Don't forget to include seasonal sounds, such as fireworks, and thunder. You can find recordings of these in pet shops, online stores, and streaming services.
Take your puppy into different environments such as an unfamiliar house, parks and shops and allow them to feel different textures such as sand, concrete, gravel and grass.
It’s also worth getting your puppy used to whichever mode of transport you’ll be using. It’s not unusual for puppies to get car sick, so start with short journeys and gradually build them up.
Puppies take several seconds to process new information. Allow them the time to adjust, and pair that moment with a positive experience, such as a tasty treat. Never force them to go towards something they're worried about - just allow them time, and have patience and understanding. Just because something isn't frightening to us, doesn't mean that it will be the same for a puppy.

Enjoy every moment
This is the start of yours and your puppy’s life together. Help them socialise as much as you can and enjoy seeing things through their eyes for the first time!         "
Rabbit health and wellbeing,"Rabbits naturally live underground, so they will also be busy digging and exploring suitable burrow options. Wild rabbits will always choose to be close to at least two to three boltholes they can escape to if they feel threatened.

When creating your rabbits' environment, try to choose items that will encourage and support this natural behaviour. This will keep them active and mentally stimulate them so they remain healthy and happy.
Keep your rabbits happy and occupied
A suitable, neutered rabbit companion is very important. A lone rabbit or one with an unsuitable companion will often remain very nervous and reluctant to come out and explore. In some cases, a single rabbit may become aggressive towards you.

Rabbits feel safe when they have plenty of areas to run into or hide. Provide your rabbits with several shelters – plastic tables and chairs, card boxes, card or plastic tunnels and even plastic cat carriers lined with newspaper and hay. Fruit tree or willow logs make great look out towers. Rabbits love to jump on them and survey their territory.
Rabbits love litter trays

 	Dig trays are a rabbit's favourite things. Fill large cat litter trays or large tray bases from indoor cages with play sand or organic soil – your rabbits will dig to their hearts' content
 	Cat litter trays lined with newspaper and filled with hay are really important – have at least three of these in corners for them to use as a toilet. Rabbits like to nibble on hay whilst using their toilet, so clean them daily so they don’t eat dirty hay
 	For rabbits living indoors or on concrete, fill plant pots and large litter trays with safe plants and growing grass. Place these in their enclosure for them to nibble at their leisure

Food can be fun too

 	Hay kebabs and forage trees. Simply take two cardboard toilet rolls and stuff one end with their favourite hay, add some dried or fresh forage into the centre and enclose with more hay. Take a willow stick and pass through the middle of the rolls. Place several of these into an empty cardboard box to make a forage tree
 	Forage bags. Half fill a paper bag with hay or dried grass, mix in some dried or fresh forage and give the whole bag to your rabbits - make sure you tear off the handle first. No rabbit can resist a rustling paper bag!
 	Stick bundles. Take 10 – 12 willow or apple sticks and tie tightly around the middle. Hang them from the sides of the run for your rabbits to reach up and enjoy
 	Plant pots. Mix some hay and dried or fresh forage into a plant pot and turn it upside down. Watch as your rabbits have fun trying to get to the treats
 	Herb planters. Grow herbs such as mint or lemon balm in a plant pot and attach an upturned hanging basket over the top. Your rabbits will nibble the herbs while they are growing but not destroy the plant’s roots
 	Mock hedges. These are garden hanging baskets or magazine racks completely stuffed with hay to avoid legs getting trapped. You can hang them up in the run to encourage your rabbit to reach up and browse
 	Gnawing twigs. Rabbits need to be able to gnaw on items to keep their teeth in good shape. Often, rabbits do not enjoy wooden chew toys as the tasty bark has been removed. Try offering apple tree or willow twigs as they love to chew all the bark off, plus it’s great for their digestive system!
 Choosing the right bedding for your rabbits
The wrong bedding for your rabbits can have a negative effect on their health. Wood shavings, sawdust and straw can often contain fur mites, and can give you an allergic reaction too!

Instead, line your rabbits’ enclosure with a thick layer of newspaper and completely cover it with a good layer of fresh, sweet-smelling green hay.

It’s often more cost-effective to purchase hay from a local farm or equine shop by the bale. You can then pick a nice, green bale and reduce the risk of it being old stock and possibly contaminated or filled with sharp thistles. Using hay as bedding also means your rabbits are free to naturally graze on the most important part of their diet at all times.
How to clean out your rabbits
Your rabbits' litter trays will need daily cleaning and refreshing with clean paper and hay.

Carry out a full clean at least once a week, although this may need to be done more often throughout the winter when they are choosing to stay indoors for longer. Remove the rabbits, fully sweep out and wipe down the enclosure and all plastic items with pet-friendly disinfectant.

Line hutches and shed floors with vinyl for an easy-to-clean and wipe surface under your rabbits' bedding.         "
Kennel cough: what you need to know,"Kennel cough is caused by an inflammation of the trachea and bronchi, and could be regarded as  the dog equivalent of the common cold. Dogs often develop kennel cough 3-4 days after exposure to a large number of other dogs – for example at a boarding facility or a show.

What are the signs of kennel cough?

 	A persistent cough is the most common symptom
 	Retching
 	Watery nasal discharge
 	In mild cases, dogs are often active and eating normally
 	In severe cases, symptoms progress and can include pneumonia, lack of appetite, fever and lethargy.

How is kennel cough treated?
The best way to treat kennel cough is with rest, hydration and good nutrition.
If your dog is more severely affected, your vet may prescribe them medication to reduce inflammation and coughing. If they have a bacterial infection, antibiotics may help shorten the course of the disease. In the unlikely event your dog develops pneumonia, they will need to be hospitalised for more intensive treatment.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment. How do I protect my dog from kennel cough?
There is a vaccination for kennel cough - your vet can advise you on this. Even after being vaccinated, your dog may still catch kennel cough – but usually a less severe form than they would have otherwise.
Most boarding kennels require a kennel cough vaccine before accepting your dog.

How do I avoid kennel cough spreading?
To prevent the spread of the disease, dogs with kennel cough should be isolated until they’re better and no longer contagious.

If you’re thinking of adopting a dog with kennel cough
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new dog and ask for more details on how the kennel cough was treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any dog who’s had kennel cough is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
Help your dog to cope with changes of routine,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, our daily routines have gone out of the window and this has impacted us as well as our pets, especially dogs. Although we’ve been able to spend more quality time indoors with our dogs, we haven’t been sicking to our ‘normal’ working routines.

This has had a significant effect on puppies that have been taken on during lockdown. This has meant they’ve been growing up without experiencing outings and have always been used to seeing their owners at home.
Things to consider
Now that the government has set out a roadmap of lifting lockdown restrictions, we all need to consider how our dogs are going to cope as our lives go back to how they were before COVID-19.

Will we be returning to the office? What about trips out to restaurants and pubs? Will you be going back to the gym or attending fitness classes again? If so, it’s important to think about how these changes will affect our canine companions.
What are the steps should you take?
Prepare
Preparation is key when it comes to thinking about returning to a routine. It is vitally important to do this gradually so it’s not a shock for your beloved dog. This will allow you time to work on anything that your dog might be struggling with.
Write a list
Jot down all the things that you might need to sort out, for example, will you need a dog sitter when you return to work? If you’re coming home a bit later than normal, will feeding times change? What about their training sessions and walks?

If you’re thinking about hiring a dog-sitter, read our article on how to choose the right pet sitter to help you choose one.
Take it slow
Gradually re-establishing an adult dog’s confidence when left home alone should be straight forward. However, for younger dogs this might be more challenging for them.

 	Set your dog up for a busy day before you need to leave him. Take him for a good walk, followed by a short session of calm, but mentally tiring activity. This can be anything from reward-based training or a scent game, this will put your dog in the right state of mind before the next step…
 	Before you get ready to put on your coat, pick up your keys and leave, keep calm and create a peaceful environment to allow your dog to relax and settle.
 	Prepare a tasty treat that’s safe to leave for your dog while you’re out. You could try a stuffed Kong toy, or a Lickimat. Pop one of these down for your dog to enjoy while you get ready to leave.

Leaving something for your dog to chew on will allow them to concentrate and provide a welcome distraction, while promoting a calm mind state. If you’re still worried, check out our article: ‘How to leave your dog on their own’.

If, after following our advice you still think your dog is struggling to adjust to changes in their routine, don’t hesitate to contact our Pet Support Team for further advice.          "
How to health check your dog,"Here are some simple checks you can do to make sure they’re in tip-top condition.

Ears
Lift the ear flap and look inside, also gently feel behind and below the whole ear. Check your dog…


 	Is free from pain
 	Has no dirt and wax
 	Has no odour – a strong smell may indicate a problem

Mouth
Gently lift up your dog’s lip folds to check their teeth and open the jaw to check in their mouth.
Check for tartar on the teeth, if your dog has lots they may need to go to the vets and have this removed as it can lead to gum disease and tooth decay. Please note: there is a direct link between poor oral health and heart disease. Also, a strong/offensive smell may indicate a problem, so it is best to get this checked with the vets.

Eyes
Check your dog’s eyes are not red and there is no excessive discharge, monitor the eyes for any cloudiness this could be a sign of cataracts developing.

Nose
Check their nose for any excessive discharge, and also for any coughing or sneezing.

Body

 	Check regularly for any lumps and bumps, note if any are changing size or shape.
 	Look for any bald patches, irritations, soreness or scabs.
 	Check for fleas and keep an eye on any excessive scratching or nibbling.
 	If your dog is long-haired, check for matts. If left, these can be uncomfortable and lead to infections.
 	Check for grass seeds, these often get missed in ears, between the toes and in dogs with long coats

Weight
Maintaining a healthy weight is important, most vets will run free weight clinics and would be more than happy to advise you if you are worried or just want to check your dog is the correct weight.
Obesity in the dog population is becoming more common, it’s a very serious health condition and it can have a considerable impact on longevity and quality of life. Have a look from the side and above. Your dog should have a slightly tucked-in waist and you should be able to feel the ribs quite easily, but they shouldn’t stick out.

Feet
Lift your dog’s feet up and gently check the pads.
Keep an eye on the length of their nails. If your dog mainly walks on grass or soft ground, you may need to cut them regularly. Ensure you don’t cut the ‘quick’ in the nails. This is a blood vessel and can hurt your dog if cut. Consider trimming between your dogs toes, this can help prevent the build-up of snow and ice in the winter and can reduce slipping on smooth floors. Bottom
Keep an eye on your dog’s faeces.


 	Loose faeces can be a sign they’re not well
 	Check there are no worms present and no blood
 	Long-haired dogs may need their back end washed and groomed regularly to prevent attracting flies

After you’ve given your dog a health check make sure you give them plenty of praise and treats. If at any point they’re not happy with being checked over, stop and try another time. Take a note of which bit they did not like being touched as this could be a sign of pain.

How to spot if your dog is unwell
Your dog may not always clearly let you know if they’re in pain or unwell. Look out for these subtle signs:


 	Lethargic
 	Restless
 	Not eating or eating less
 	Excessive drinking
 	Stiffness and lameness
 	Keeping to themselves, not wanting to be fussed
 	Out of the ordinary behaviour, e.g. growling when touched

If you have any concerns about the health of your dog, consult your vet immediately

Keep them vaccinated
Vaccinations should be given yearly by your vet and will protect your dog from potentially fatal diseases.

Worming your dog
Worming treatments should be given approximately every three months. A worm infestation can not only cause health problems to your dog but can, in some cases, spread to humans and has been known to cause blindness in children.

Dealing with fleas
Flea treatments should be given every couple of months. It is important to use good quality veterinary flea, and worming, treatments as some cheaper ones are not as effective. If you already have a flea infestation it is important you treat your house as well as the dog. The majority of fleas actually live in the household. Regular vacuuming and washing of the dogs bedding alongside house treatment will also help.         "
How to manage your dog's weight,"Weight problems are common in dogs, but even a little excess weight could cause health conditions, such as arthritis, diabetes, severe heart disease, liver disease and depression.
Dogs that have a health weight live longer than an overweight dog. If your dog is overweight, you could be shortening their lifespan by as much as two years. The good news is that improving your dog's diet and exercise will make a significant difference.

Is my dog overweight?
Here what to look out for:


 	You should be able to feel your dog’s ribs when you run your hands gently down their side.
 	Have you had to loosen your dog’s collar recently?
 	Watch them as they get up, are they slow or having difficulty?
 	Perhaps they’re sleeping more than usual.
 	Have you noticed them getting out of breath quickly on a walk?

For more information, check out this Dog Size-O-Meter, a visual guide put together by the Pet Food Manufacturers Association.

Why is my dog overweight?
It’s important to know that some medical conditions can actually cause weight gain, speaking to your vet and taking your dog for regular check-ups is a useful tool in managing your dog’s overall health and wellbeing.
Often the most loved and cherished pet dogs are amongst those most likely to be grossly overweight. We might reward them and show them how good they are by given them one too many treats, so it’s important to limit extra titbits we give our dogs and always check the food labels and weigh out your dog’s food.
Age and breed are also big factors when it comes to weight gain in dogs. Spaniels in particular are more prone to putting on weight, but the risk is the same for any type of dog. All dogs can become overweight so it’s important to take the necessary steps to prevent this. One other factor to take into consideration is neutering as this alters a dog’s metabolism and this can make them gain weight. As dogs get older, they become less active and are more prone to weight gain.

Helping your dog lose weight
If your dog is overweight, create a plan of action.
Exercise is one of the best ways to help your dog lose that unwanted, excess weight. And if you struggle to get out for walks in the park or countryside, there are plenty of ways you can incorporate exercise into your dog’s routine, whether it’s in the house or garden. Many dogs love toys, so fetch or search games are excellent forms of physical and mental exercise.
Try a healthy treat swaps. Instead of giving your dog a titbit when you’re eating, try offering vegetables like carrots, broccoli or cabbage. To begin with they may be unlikely to eat it and will be expecting you to provide their usual treat, but you will need to stay firm and stick to your goals.
Most veterinary surgeries run free weight clinics. The nurses will help you weigh your dog, and work out a daily food amount. You can pop back for regular weigh-ins just like a slimming club. If your dog is seriously overweight, the next step might be putting them on a special prescription food diet.

How do I stop my dog from becoming overweight again?
Feeding titbits is the biggest factor we can change. The occasional ""good dog"" biscuit here and there can contribute greatly to weight gain. Owners often struggle to not respond to their dog when they’re sitting right there asking for a biscuit, bit of cake, or a crisp. Every time we give them a little titbit when we see the ‘puppy dog eyes’ looking at us, we are reinforcing and rewarding their asking behaviour. When we reinforce that behaviour, we are strengthening it and in turn, increase the likelihood of it happening again.
Many dry complete diets are easy to over feed, your dog only needs a small portion to provide all of the daily nutritional requirements. Always check the packaging and weigh your dog’s food out. Some manufactured foods also contain a lot of fat and sugar, so always read the ingredients on the packaging to make sure you know what you are feeding your dog.          "
How to care for older dogs,"What to feed older dogs
Consider changing your dog’s food to a senior diet and feed them smaller meals two to three times a day. Avoid feeding them snacks in-between meals as obesity can be a problem in older, less active dogs.

Exercising older dogs
They may be less active, but it’s important your dog still has daily walks to keep their brain active and joints mobile. Allow your dog to set the pace and try to go for frequent short walks rather than one long walk.

Look after your dog’s health
Have your dog checked by a vet at least twice a year and look out for signs of:


 	loss of appetite
 	coughing or breathing difficulties
 	growths or lumps on his body
 	weakness, lameness or reluctance to exercise
 	increased thirst or urination
 	diarrhoea or constipation
 	a fever or an increase in heart or breathing rate
 	changes in behaviour
 	check your dog’s teeth regularly
 Changes in your dog’s behaviour
Be aware that older dogs are more sensitive to loud or sudden noises and tend to sleep more. Make time to play calm games with them such as scent exercises to help them remain mentally active. Many behavioural changes in older dogs are due to an underlying medical disorder. They can be a little less tolerant of being picked up or receiving lots of attention.  They can become a little grumpy if they are disturbed when resting owing to sore joints so children need to be advised to treat them with more care and respect – seek advice from a vet if you have any concerns.
There is never a shortage of older dogs at our rehoming centres looking for a new place to call their own, with many years of life left to enjoy.
Unfortunately, older dogs are more difficult to rehome. By offering one of our senior residents a loving new home you will be making a personal contribution to animal welfare. Take a look at all of our older dogs currently looking for homes.

Alternative ways to exercise your dog,"Unlike most other pet species, dogs like to be in the company of their favourite human, enjoy visiting new places, meeting other dogs and people and exploring their natural surroundings.

Walking is one of the most popular forms of exercise for your dog, but it’s not the only way to keep a dog fit, happy and healthy. For some dogs, walking is not an option, as they may have a physical issue that causes discomfort when walking. Others may have experienced an unpleasant encounter which has put them off leaving the house. In other cases, perhaps a dog’s behaviour could put them or you, along with other people and animals at risk.
Reasons why dogs might not want to go for a walk
Health
If you notice a change in your dog’s attitude towards exercise, it’s vitally important to have your dog checked by a vet as a change in exercise habits can indicate a medical issue.
Age
It’s very common for older dogs to develop arthritis and other age-related conditions. And whilst these can be improved with medications, you may need to consider reducing their activity levels. Elderly dogs can also become less socially confident as they become frail, this might make them more anxious and reluctant to walk away from their own property. This could be related to underlying pain, so regular health checks are a vital part of their care.
Hot weather
An annual issue that all dog owners should consider is hot weather. All dogs are at risk of heat stroke, especially on hot days. Because of this, walking is an exercise that should be avoided, especially during the hottest part of the day.
Reactive dogs
Dogs who lunge and bark at dogs are described as reactive. They might be frightened of something in their surroundings, other dogs or noises and this can be very stressful for the dog and their owner on a walk. Overcoming this issue involves lots time dedicated towards their training on every walk. Training may or may not be successful, but there are lots of different options to explore. Providing activities at home will fulfil your dog’s basic need to exercise and promote better concentration while training on your walks.
Alternative walking exercises
There are many excellent alternatives to walking, which can help give your dog all of the mental and physical exercise they need.
Exercising older dogs  
If you have an elderly dog, allowing them to potter round the garden may be enough exercise. Exercising in the garden gives your dog the option to stop and rest without the restrictions of a lead influencing their movement and pace. If your golden oldie isn’t up to walking the distances they used to, then some quality time doing whatever they enjoy is important. If they like the car, you can still drive to their favourite places and enable them to explore and mooch around before  driving home again.
Enrichment feeding
A dog should be given their food in a way that boosts their physical and mental wellbeing. Bowl feeding is effective for frail or very sick dogs as you can ensure they’ve taken their medication if necessary while monitoring when and how much they’ve eaten. For most other dogs, their food should be delivered in a more interesting and time-consuming way.
Garden exercise for active dogs
Search games – find the hidden gem!
All dogs love and excel in search games. Whilst some breeds instinctively use their noses and others favour their eyesight, with practice any dog will enjoy search games. An interesting garden is great for find it games, especially if you have an establish area with weeds or long grass, it’s perfect for hiding treasures! Alternatively, if you have garden furniture or large planter or pots, these can be great places to hide toys behind as well.

If your dog is motivated by tasty food than toys, then scent games are a fantastic way of boosting their mood. Scent work activities are valuable tools to help dogs who are nervous or finding different factors of their life stressful.
Train to exercise the brain
Dogs love learning and reward-based training is motivating, challenging, fun and tiring. It’s a great way of improving your dog’s response and growing a bond between you both. Learn how to make it fun by taking our diy dog training course.
Home assault courses
Home obstacle equipment such as tunnels, weave poles, and hoops are now easily available. It’s important to note however, that jumping can be dangerous and needs to be introduced properly. If you want to try this out at home, the use of a hoop for your dog to go through can be very effective. This type of activity is great for active dogs who need to express their energy and relieve their excitement. As there’s no jumping involved, it’s perfect for dog’s who benefit from lower impact activities.
Hired exercise areas
If you don’t have a suitable garden for your dog to exercise, there are lots of safe and secure paddocks you can hire for sole use. This gives you the opportunity to provide off-lead exercise in a larger area than most gardens.

Here’s an website to get you started. Local pet shops or your veterinary practice may know of others in your area. Make sure you visit and check out the facility before booking.

Dogs and children - How to keep your children safe,"However, it’s important to remember that your dog doesn’t think, understand and communicate in the same way we do. Children should never be left unsupervised with any dog, whether at home or out on a walk – regardless of the breed or how well they know them.

Watch our dog safety video below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgEC7kBjujk Creating a dog- and child-friendly home
Keep dog toys out of your dog’s reach so they learn they can only play at the invitation of an adult. Make sure your children tidy their toys away so your dog knows not to play with them.
Teach your children to respect your dog’s physical and emotional welfare. They shouldn’t tease your dog, pull their fur or tail, or take their food away from them.
Always make sure your dog has a safe area where they can have some quiet time alone away from the children.

Dogs and toddlers
Your dog still needs peace and quiet sometimes; allow him a place to escape to. If friends’ children come to visit make sure the dog can escape to his safe den if he needs to.
Toddlers won’t be able to read a dog’s body language and toddlers are quite unpredictable for the dog. Beware of a sudden grab, impulsive hug or a twisted ear. Toddlers can easily lose their balance and fall on a sleeping dog! Don’t expect your dog to put up with pulled ears just because he is tolerant.
Dogs are fight or flight animals. They will usually try to get away if unhappy, but if this is not an option then fight is what’s left to them. Try not to let things get this far, signs of an unhappy dog include; yawning, lip licking, ears back, trying to get away, growling, snapping and showing teeth.
Teach your children from day one that the dog is not a toy. Children should never approach a sleeping, eating, unwell or tired dog. The dog and the child need to respect each other’s space.
Teach your dog manners so that when your toddler starts to crawl/walk, the dog doesn’t try and barge through doorways or upstairs first.

Help them stay safe around dogs
Many children love seeing dogs when they’re out and about - but sometimes dogs can mistake their friendliness for aggression. Teach them these simple rules to help keep your children safe:


 	Always ask the owner before approaching, stroking or playing with a dog
 	Never rush up to a dog, be calm and make slow movements so you don’t frighten him
 	Hold out your hand and let him come to you. If he doesn’t want to come, leave him alone
 	Don’t stare directly into a dog’s eyes
 	If a dog growls at you or seems aggressive, stay calm and slowly walk away
 	If a dog is eating, drinking, sleeping or tied up, you should leave him alone

Getting your dog used to their collar and harness,"Collar Grab
Some dogs actually don’t like it, they may feel uncomfortable, or have had a previously unpleasant experience when a person grabbed them. Your dog might find having their collar grabbed so worrying, and they may snap at the hand. This is where people could get bitten.
We can help dogs learn to cope with having their collar grabbed by starting off very gently. You can do this simple exercise with puppies and adult dogs. The first step is to feed your dog a treat and either touch the collar, or if that makes your dog uncomfortable, reaching towards your dog’s collar is a good start. We are pairing the touch of your hand on the collar, or the intention to touch the collar with a treat. You can either use treats, or one of your dog’s meals to do this exercise. It can help if you give a verbal indication of what you are about to do, as it helps your dog understand what is about to happen.
Slowly build up the intensity of the touch, ensuring that you always pair the hold with a treat. As your dog becomes more comfortable, start to give the treat after the touch, and start to hold the collar for longer, and even move your hand around whilst holding the collar. Always go at your dog’s pace, and make sure their comfortable before you move on.

Getting your dog used to his harness
Another problem we deal with regularly is dogs that are reluctant to put their harness on. Some dogs can find this so aversive, and it can affect their enjoyment of their walk.
If your dog has a really negative reaction to their harness, it is a good idea to get a new one to start this training, so there won’t be the background association of bad feelings.
The first step is to place the harness on the floor and reward your dog for looking at it. You can even place treats in and around the harness for your dog to investigate.
The next step is to ask your dog to look at and investigate the harness while you hold it. This is quite a different step to looking at the harness while it is on the floor, so take your time. Once your dog is really comfortable looking at and investigating the harness while you hold it, start to change the way you hold it. This is particularly important if it’s the kind of harness that goes over the dogs head.
Feed your dog treats while you move the harness, and even place your hand through the harness and feed the dog in the position of having the harness held up in front of his face. This is the scary bit for most dogs, so it’s worth working on this. Then lure your dog to push his head through the harness. You may have to do this in stages. With training like this, when we are asking the dog to face something he may find worrying, it’s important to keep sessions short. 2-3 minutes and then a play session will allow the dog to relax.
You can also give verbal clues during this exercise. “Put your harness on” or “pick up your foot” can help the dog know what’s coming next and be more relaxed about it.
During both of these training exercises, it is important to remember that we are building confidence. It is not about forcing the dog to have these things done to them, it’s about them learning that it’s not scary, so make sure you only progress at your individual dog’s pace.

Need more advice?
If you are having trouble with either of these exercises, please get in touch. Our team will be happy to provide free behavioural advice and support.          "
How to tell if your dog has a behaviour problem,"Sometimes what one person considers a behaviour problem, another person considers desirable. For example, a husky pulling is desirable if you want them to move the sledge, but if you are walking to the park with your dog, then pulling on the lead is an undesirable trait.
It’s well known that all behaviour is directly related to an individual's emotional state. In other words, how we feel drives how we express ourselves, and animals are the same. If we invest in ensuring we meet their mental, physical, and emotional needs, we are likely to have a well-rounded and content pet. Meeting their needs in a breed and age-appropriate way goes a long way to preventing and overcoming behaviour problems.
Habituation, socialisation, and training are key points we should consider. These words are often recognised and considered important with puppies, and can be overlooked with older dogs. Like us, dogs continue to learn as they get older, and therefore we need to invest and embrace their learning throughout adult life.
In a perfect world, all puppies would be well-bred and raised. We would have invested in their early learning, and continue throughout their lives to make sure their needs are properly met. However, even if you’ve done a great job of raising your puppy, or maybe you’ve taken on a dog from a previous home or rescue charity, there will be lots of issues to consider along the way.
It can be incredibly stressful and worrying if your dog has a behaviour problem, and the best approach is to be proactive and seek help as soon as possible. Getting advice, support, and gaining an understanding of how to approach solving an issue is the first step to overcoming it, as it can be much harder to change a behaviour that’s been long established and is well practiced.

What you can do about your dog’s chewing,"Dogs can and will chew things. It's a very natural way for them to relieve stress and boredom while staying calm and happy. It's also a great way of keeping their teeth healthy. For young dogs, chewing helps to strengthen their teeth and gums. For older dogs, it's a great way of reducing tartar.

Chewing isn't a 'puppy problem'. All dogs enjoy chewing throughout their lives. There are lots of different ways to encourage this natural behaviour in a way that benefits your dog.
How to stop unwanted chewing
Sometimes, things can get out of hand, especially when your dog starts chewing valuables or things that could harm them. Good news is, there are a number of things you can do.
The best place to start is by ensuring belongings and valuables are tidied away and out of reach of your dog. The next thing to do is buy a selection of chew toys for your dog or puppy. These could include rubber toys, especially ones that can be put in the freezer to calm gum inflammation in teething pups.
There are also plenty of edible items you can give your dog that require a lot of chewing, like cow ears, veggie chews, antlers and hooves. Always keep an eye on your dog when they're given one of these and swap the last slimy mouthful for a tasty treat to avoid any risk of choking. Replicate natural behaviours
If your dog likes a good chew consider purchasing a kong.  These are cone shaped hollow rubber toys that have been designed to be stuffed with food.  In the natural world wild dogs spend hours foraging and hunting for food – it keeps them fit, entertained and stimulated.
Our pet dogs have had this role taken away from them. Their food is served up in a bowl twice a day and it’s generally gone in a matter of seconds. Kong feeding or scatter feeding – throwing your dog’s food across the floor or grass – makes your dog work for their food, tiring them out mentally and physically.

Other ways to prevent chewing

 	Walk your dog before leaving them home alone, this will make them more tired and more likely to sleep in your absence
 	Do some training before you leave, this will help tire your dog’s brain and make them sleepy
 	As soon as you return, pick up the items you leave down for them while you’re out – so they remain interesting.

What to do about your dog mouthing,"As they become more playful they can start mouthing in play and grabbing at clothing. This might seem cute when they are young puppies, but it won’t be as they get older, their teeth get sharper and the bites get stronger.
It’s important you teach your puppy not to mouth. You might not mind them doing it to you, but other people might not realise they’re playing. Think about what could happen if they do it to a child or someone worried by dogs.

How to control the strength of mouthing
First, teach your puppy bite inhibition - this means controlling the strength of their mouthing. If your dog starts mouthing you and does it particularly hard, give out a high-pitched yelp as if you’re hurt.
This should startle your puppy so they stop and look at you. Praise them for stopping and start playing again. Repeat this process as needed.
If this isn’t working, after you give out the yelp ignore them for about 20 seconds. If they continue to pester you, you can even walk away for 20 seconds. Your puppy should soon learn they get play and attention when they’re being gentle.

Transfer the mouthing onto toys or chews
Second, transfer your dog’s mouthing onto toys or chews. Some puppies will mouth you every time you try and stroke them as well as in play.
Try feeding your puppy some treats with one hand while you stroke them with the other. If you have a puppy that likes grabbing at clothing, stand still and get them interested in a toy instead.
Enjoy playing with your puppy but play non-contact games like tug-of-war and fetch. Wrestling and rough play can encourage mouthing and grabbing, and it will take longer to get your puppy out of the habit.          "
Cold weather tips for dog owners,"During the freezing winter months, there are plenty of ways to keep ourselves warm and toasty, but what about for our dogs? Good news is, there are lots of things you can do to make sure your canine companion stays warm and comfortable in cold weather.
Top tips on keeping your dog warm

 	Provide a snuggly dog bed away from any draughts.
 	Look out for your short-haired breeds and elderly dogs. They can really feel the cold and will appreciate a warm dog coat or jumper when out on walks.
 	Trim any long stragglers of hair between your dog’s toes to prevent ice, snow and rock salt sticking to their fur.
 	Keep your dog warm and cosy inside, including in cars. Don’t be tempted to nip out and leave them in the car as the temperature can drop very quickly.
 	Sometimes we all just want to stay inside on cold days and the same goes for dogs. Provide lots of indoor activities and toys to keep them entertained, active and happy.
 	If your dog suffers with joint issues, it’s worth checking with your vet if they can prescribe joint supplements or pain killers as cold weather can worsen this pain.

Be safe, be seen on walks
Naturally, we want to stay inside when it’s grim outdoors so walks tend to be shorter and dogs remain on the lead. That’s why it’s important to be prepared and consider reflective collars, leads and coats for walks, especially if you live somewhere rural.
Weather warnings
Britain doesn’t always resemble a winter wonderland, sadly, our winters bring hazardous rain storms and high winds resulting in waterlogged muddy fields. Long-haired dogs often come home filthy and wet meaning the clean-up can often be longer than the walk itself!

Great news is, there are full coverage waterproof dog suits and coats on the market that will help keep your dog somewhat clean and dry on those wet winter walks.

On particularly cold days when Jack Frost has been, we’d recommend staying away from frozen lakes or rivers. If you think your dog will be tempted to run onto the ice, keep them on a lead.
Beware of toxic substances
You might find yourself digging out the antifreeze for your car on particularly icy days, just make sure you mop up any spillages and firmly tighten the lids of the bottles. Antifreeze is highly toxic to pets including dogs and they’re attracted to its sweet taste and aroma. If you think your dog may have consumed antifreeze, contact your vet immediately.

Thoroughly wipe your dog’s paws dry when they come inside after a walk. Gritted pathways can cause irritation. If your dog happens to lick their sore pads before their paws are wiped down, they might ingest the salt from the grit, leading to dehydration and in severe cases liver problems.          "
How to help your dog settle in,"Everything is brand new to them, and it can be overwhelming. They’ll be looking to you for guidance, so here’s what you can do help your dog settle in their forever home.
When you first arrive home, take your dog to the garden or exercise area and allow them to relieve themselves.  After you’re sure they’ve done this, praise your dog so they understand this is an acceptable place to go to the toilet.
When the dog first comes home, the trust bucket is empty. As your relationship grows and he feels safe, the trust bucket fills up. For activities like teeth cleaning, bathing, and grooming, it's better to wait until he's settled and your relationships are established. Friends and extended family will be keen to meet your new dog. However, the best approach is to wait until he or she feels relaxed and settled before they meet your visitors.
Take some time off work to help your dog settle.

Help them to feel safe and secure when home alone
Even if you don't need to leave your dog very often, it's good to help them feel safe and comfortable when they are alone. When paired with a positive experience like a taste chew, baby gates can be great for helping establish positive emotions when being separated from you. This can be the first steps towards your dog being content when left home alone.
Using tasty treats and chews, try popping them behind the baby gate to get your new dog used to being alone in a room. Providing they are happy, gradually build up the time you leave them alone in the room. Always ensure they have a chew with them to keep them occupied. Teaching your dog to be comfortable alone will allow them to relax when you leave the house. We do have an article on leaving your dog at home alone. Dealing with challenging behaviour
For the first couple of weeks, your dog will be getting used to the routines and establishing their relationship with his new family. Sometimes once they feel settled, they demonstrate out of character behaviours to see where the boundaries lie. Your dog will feel happier if you set boundaries and ground rules which the whole family sticks to.
Never use punishment to overcome problems with your dog. This will cause resentment and will break down the good relationship you’re building with him. If you're experiencing problems with your dog settling in, please contact our Pet Services Support team on 0300 303 9333, or by filling out a form.

Top tips for settling your new dog

 	Stay with your dog when they go to the toilet. This is the only way to ensure they have relieved themselves and to reward them at the same time.
 	Try to keep to boundaries and ground rules, your dog will feel much happier if they know exactly what is expected of them.

Preparing a dog for your new baby,"Before your baby arrives
By making some preparations in advance you can help your dog get used to the much-anticipated new arrival. It’s important to make time for your dog so they don’t feel pushed out when the baby arrives. You’ll still need to walk and play with them. Babies can be all-consuming, so if you’re struggling for time get a friend, family member or dog walker to help you out.

If there are going to be rooms that your dog will be excluded from when the baby arrives, prepare them for that early on by introducing baby gates as soon as you can.

Make sure your dog is well trained. Work on their lead training so you’re able to walk your dog and a pushchair. Practice useful commands such as sit, stay and leave. How to train your dog.

Your dog may find everyday baby situations hard – screaming, crying or arm waving can trigger an unexpected reaction in your dog. If you feel your dog may be worried by the noise of the baby crying, try getting them used to the noise before you have the baby. Search the internet for soothing sounds and playlists to prepare your dog for the noises a baby will make, including crying and children playing.
Top tips to prepare your dog for a new baby

 	If your dog is used to a certain routine, adjust it before the baby arrives
 	Wrap a doll in a blanket and carry it round the house, give the doll attention
 	Before the baby comes home, bring your dog a blanket with the baby’s scent on it
 	Wear the dog out before their first meeting with the baby, a tired dog is more likely to be calm.

Taking your baby home
Let your dog meet and sniff the new arrival. Try and quell your nerves as he might sense this. Remember, you’re in control. Be calm but set boundaries: the baby is not for nibbling, licking or jumping on. Be careful, but not overly so; you know your dog and how much you can trust him.

Include your dog in the process of adjustment. If they seem restless or worried when you’re feeding the baby, ask them to sit or stay beside you and offer them toys or treats. This way, they come to associate the experience as a good one.

Keep the dog and baby separate at all times, but they need to be aware of one another. Never leave a young child unsupervised with a dog: no one has eyes in the back of their head.

Finally, be aware of potential hazards. For example, don’t leave your baby in a high chair or cot where your dog could knock it over.          "
How to prepare your pregnant dog for whelping,"During the gestation period, which can range from 57 to 65 days, you should prepare everything you need for the birth, including a whelping box.
At what age can my dog become pregnant?
Female dogs come into season from the time they turn six months, or later on for larger dog breeds. This means a dog is fertile and will normally attract males for mating.
How to tell if your dog is pregnant 
The way to find out whether your dog is pregnant is to contact your vet about four to five weeks from the time of conception to arrange a check-up. If she’s relaxed, the vet might be able to feel small lumps the size of table tennis balls in her womb. You can also have her scanned (around 25-30 days) to confirm whether she is pregnant or not.

Bear in mind, a scan just gives you a cross-section at any point, and for this reason, it’s not possible to know exactly how many puppies there are.

Her belly may also swell as it would during a woman’s pregnancy, but if your dog is carrying a small litter or she has a well-muscled tummy it may be difficult to tell just by looking at her.
How long are dogs pregnant?
Dogs are pregnant for an average of 63 days. The date is not from when she is mated but when she ovulated. Canine semen can remain in the womb for up to seven days, and because of this, it can be difficult to know the due date for sure, but you can prepare for it. With the variation in dog sizes, it is hard to tell how far along the pregnancy is.
How will I know when my dog has gone into labour?
The first stage of labour is nesting, you might notice your dog preparing the spot she’s picked to give birth to her puppies. She might appear restless for the first 24 hours and her body temperature will drop. She might also refuse food and have clear/watery vaginal discharge. What should you expect?
Birth is a natural process, it might be quite daunting but there are things you should expect to see when it comes to your dog whelping. Here are some things that are completely normal to see from your dog:

 	Laying on her side straining and yelping
 	Puppies will come out of the birth canal in a small sac of fluid that will break
 	After the puppy has been delivered, mum will bite the umbilical cord and the placenta will normally follow within 15 minutes
 	Mothers will automatically eat the placenta to regain the nutrients lost from the birth, this allows them to regain their strength ready to deliver the next puppies. It’s best not to interfere with this, even if makes the mum sick, she will stop when she’s had enough
 	It’s normal for the mother to rest for up to two hours between puppies.

When should you seek medical assistance from a vet? 
There are warning signs you should be on the lookout for. Seeking veterinary advice as soon as you spot a problem will ensure the safe delivery of your dog’s puppies.

 	A green discharge but no sign of puppies - if you see green discharge, the placenta has separated from the womb and a puppy should arrive soon after. If there’s no sign of a puppy, it may be time to call the vet
 	Vigorous straining when pushing a puppy for over half an hour
 	If it’s been more than two hours before another puppy is born
 	If she looks unwell or exhausted.

How can I tell when labour has finished? 
It can be tricky to know when a dog has finished giving birth, even if she’s settled and stopped straining and especially if you’re not entirely sure how many puppies to expect. If you have any concerns a vet can tell with either a scan of her belly or an X-ray.
What if she needs a caesarean?
If the expectant mother is struggling to give birth normally, a vet will assess your dog and decide if a caesarean is recommended. In some cases, they might try an injection to stimulate contractions, as long as there are no puppies blocking the birth canal. For brachycephalic breeds, it’s more common for puppies to get stuck as their head is quite large compared to the pelvis.

When it comes to performing a caesarean for dogs, this would have to be under general anaesthetic, and therefore there are risks just like any operation. If this was an accidental pregnancy some vets will offer to spay her at the same time to prevent further pregnancies.

Mum and puppies will need to be carefully observed on recovery as the mum is likely to be disorientated from the anaesthetic.

Degus: your day-to-day guide,"Find out how to care for your degus day-to-day below.
What do degus eat?
Degus are herbivores – so they only eat plant-based food, not meat. Feed your degus a good quality diet to avoid health conditions like dental disease and diabetes.

 	Your degu’s diet should be made up of around 80% good quality hay varieties – such as meadow hay, alfalfa, orchard grass – and small amounts of timothy hay
 	5% should be good quality nugget feed. One to two tablespoons of nuggets a day is ample for one to two degus
 	15% natural, healthy forage treats should top up the last of your degus’ diet. Take care to choose healthy treats as it can be very easy to over feed sugary treats, which will lead to health problems.

Healthy treats for degus

 	Apple, pear or willow tree twigs and branch cuttings
 	Rose wood, ideally remove any large thorns
 	Dried herbs and seed pods purchased from a pet store such as the mountain mix or mallow root

How to handle your degus
Degus are naturally fast and wriggly animals, and many don’t enjoy being handled. Spend time slowly socialising your degus to help them feel safe and confident around you, and they may learn to enjoy being handled in their own time.

Spend 10-20 minutes each evening talking to your degus and offering them a treat to encourage them to feed from your hands. Once they feel confident with this, offer them your arm to sniff and hop onto. Never try to grab your degu suddenly as this can cause them a lot of stress and they may bite you.

If you need to catch your degus for health checking or during free-range time, place a tunnel out for them to get into. This way, you can safely lift them without causing them stress.

If your degus have become hand tame, you may find they will voluntarily climb into your hands or on to your arm. It’s important you don’t rush this.
Free-range time
Once your degus are settled with your daily routine and happy to feed from your hands, you can allow them some free-range time in a secure room.

Ideally, this is the room that the cage is housed in. Make sure all wires are protected and any house plants are removed. Your degus will run around fast exploring the room, so make sure the room is completely safe and secure.          "
Dog theft - what to do,"The heartbreak that an owner feels when their beloved pet is stolen is devastating. Not knowing where they are, what’s happening to them, are they still alive? Are they being fed and cared for?

Our dogs are more than our pets, they are our friends, our companions, and they love us unconditionally. To have them stolen away from us is terrifying.
How to reduce the risk of your dog being stolen
There are things that owners can do to reduce the risk of having their dog stolen.

Do not leave your dog unattended: In order to stop the ‘opportunist thief’, owners should never leave their dog unattended outside a shop or school. It takes two seconds for someone to grab your dog and either run away with them or bundle them into a car.

Avoid leaving your dog unattended in a vehicle: Take them with you, or have someone stay with them.

Avoid walking in secluded areas: There have been cases where owners have been approached by strangers offering to buy their dog or even forcibly take them from the owner.  Try not to walk in secluded areas whilst the risk of theft is so high.

Monitor when off-lead: If you let your dog off lead when walking be sure to keep him close to you so that you can put him back on his lead to keep him safe if someone is acting suspiciously.

Avoid kennelling in a garden, if you can: Dogs that are kennelled in a garden seem to be regularly targeted. If this can be avoided, it would be safer.

Secure your gates and garden: If your dog has free access to your garden, it is advisable to ensure that your gate has two bolts on the top and bottom, and a padlock if possible. Don’t leave your dog unattended in a garden if they can be seen from a footpath or road.

Be mindful of social media: Be mindful about posting pictures of your new puppy on social media as you can never be sure who might be a little too interested in him. It's a good idea to turn off location tracking on your social posts, so people cannot see the location you have posted your image. What to do if your dog is stolen or missing
This is something that no pet owner ever wants to encounter. If the worst happens and your dog is stolen, notify the police and the Dog Lost service.

Ensure you have your dogs microchip details close to hand and updated with the latest contact information, and be sure to have some photographs of them to prove ownership.

An introduction to gerbils,"They enjoy living in family groups and will spend hours grooming and foraging together. Although these energetic little mammals are not keen on being handled, they can still make a lovely and interesting addition to any family.
Fast Facts: 
Companionship:  Gerbils really do prefer the company of their own kind and are most happy living in small same sex family groups.
Life expectancy: Gerbils can live up to 3-5 years.
Accomodation: Gerbils are best housed in a large fish tank or an Ikea detolf display cabinet as they prefer to live underground so need the ability to dig deep.
The ideal size tank for a pair or small group of gerbils is 100cm wide by 30cm deep by 30cm high. This will require a mesh lid constructing to keep them secure and well ventilated.
Diet: Gerbils are omnivores, they require a well balance diet of seeds, grains, pulses and meat sources.
Health: Gerbils are generally quite healthy animals. Often most illness comes with old age or poor husbandry. Always carry out a health check on your gerbils each week to monitor for any changes in their behaviour, movement, toileting and general appearance.
Family friendly: Gerbils rarely enjoy being handled so do suit a family who are happy to watch them over trying to handle.          "
How to handle your mice,"Be patient with your mouse
When your mouse arrives in their new home, avoid handling them for a day or two to allow them to settle in. When preparing to handle your mouse, ensure they are alert and aware of your movements.

Mice can find a hand suddenly hovering above them when they are resting very threatening. Ideally, handle your mice during their active periods. This will reduce the stress of waking them up as they can have sporadic sleep patterns.
How to pick your mouse up
The best way to pick up your mouse is to cup your hands under them, gently lift them towards your body and let them sit on your hands. Never pick your mouse up by the middle or the end of the tail as this can injure or even remove it!

If you do pick them up by their tail, this should be done at the very base as close to their bottom as possible. As soon as you’ve lifted them, place them on your hand. Don't let them dangle by their tail.

Mice can make sudden movements, which could lead to injuries if they fall while you’re standing up. For the first few weeks, sit on the floor and allow your mice to walk over each hand or sit in your lap.
How to transport your mice
Always have a suitable pet carrier available in case you need to rush your mice to the vet – or to use while you clean out the cage.

To keep your mice relaxed and happy, place some of the bedding in the base of the carrier along with a little house or tunnel. Lastly, scatter a small amount of food inside the carrier for your mice to enjoy.          "

Chinchilla health,"Make sure you find a chinchilla-friendly vet who has experience with them – and be prepared for unexpected vet bills if you don’t have insurance.

Dental health in chinchillas
Chinchillas can be prone to dental problems. Unless they have inherited them from their parents, dental problems are usually due to a poor diet or even an inappropriate environment.
You will only be able to easily see your chinchilas’ front set of teeth, known as the incisors. These should be dark orange in colour. The top and bottom set should meet nicely, be level and not at an angle.
If you spot any of these signs, your chinchilla could have dental problems. Contact your vet if you have any concerns:


 	One or both eyes weeping
 	Drooling
 	Playing with food but not eating it completely
 	Teeth become lighter in colour
 	Teeth appear to be growing apart or at an angle
 	Face appears swollen or abscess appears along jaw line
 	Reduced faeces or size reduced
 	Matted fur on the inside of their front legs
 Weight issues in chinchillas
Chinchillas can be prone to becoming overweight. This is often due to being overfed and a lack of exercise. Try to avoid treats that are high in sugar, including pet shop treats like chew sticks. Surprisingly, many fruits are also unsuitable – avoid raisins, sunflower seeds and nuts or give them in small amounts.
Encourage your chinchillas to forage rather than sit and overeat from their bowl. Hide healthy treats around their cage, and place hay in paper bags and in plant pots in the cage too. Safe free-range time in a chinchilla-proof room will also help your chinchillas stay fit.
Sudden weight loss can be a sign of serious health conditions like dental disease or stress. If you notice any sudden changes in your chinchillas’ eating habits or weight, contact your vet.

Leg injuries in chinchillas
Chinchillas love to explore and move quickly. However, if the environment is not safe for them, they can get seriously injured.
Furnish your chinchillas’ cage with fun activities to keep them occupied. Avoid any items that could trap their legs or they could become tangled up in. If you notice any change in your chinchillas’ movements or swellings in their legs, talk to your vet.

Fur slip and moulting in chinchillas
Chinchillas are known for their beautiful thick coat, which is very soft and dense. Your chinchillas will go through a moult every three to four months, typically starting from their head and working its way down. This gives their coat a wavy appearance as the new fur grows through.
Handle your chinchillas slowly and avoid surprises as this can cause fur slip. This is when your chinchilla releases a clump of their fur to loosen your grip and escape. Although it does not harm them and the fur will regrow, it can be very stressful and is a response to fear.         "
How many chinchillas should you keep?,"In the wild, they can live in large groups covering a large area of land. They enjoy feeding and grooming together – and also use one another for security by making vocal ‘alert’ sounds.
Ideally, chinchillas should be housed in same-sex pairs, or a castrated male can live with one or more females. Introducing chinchillas to a new companion is possible but must be done with great care and patience. They can be extremely territorial and aggressive if it’s not done correctly.

Introducing chinchillas to each other
When introducing chinchillas, use the split mix or side-by-side method. This involves having their cages side-by-side for a week or two to allow them to get used to the possibility of living together.
If your chinchillas spit and urinate through the bars at each other, you will need to make the distance between the cages slightly bigger – and then, slowly bring them closer together again.
Once they are quite content with the arrangement, allow them to have some free-range time together in a secure, chinchilla-friendly room. Place healthy treats, food, boxes and items for them to investigate around the room.
You may need to carry this out for 10-15 minutes daily for a week or so until they seem content with each other and you are observing friendly behavioural signs.

Signs your chinchillas accept each other

 	Groom themselves or each other
 	Eating contently alone or with the new companion
 	Sitting next to each other
 	Following each other in a calm, relaxed manner whilst exploring.

If you see these signs, place your chinchillas together in a clean, neutral cage. Ideally, do this in the morning after an exploring session, as they are more likely to settle down and sleep than squabble. Signs your chinchillas may not be suited

 	Spitting regularly
 	Urinating towards one another
 	Actively seeking the other out and starting a fight
 	Rearing up at each other, mouths open
 	Full fight or fur flying

Your ferrets' health: what to look out for,"Make sure you find a ferret-friendly vet who has experience with them – and be prepared for unexpected vet bills if you don’t have insurance.

Ferret life expectancy
Ferrets generally live to between eight and ten years old.

Ferret vaccinations
Ferrets must be vaccinated against canine distemper. Ferrets are susceptible to it and it can often be fatal. Initial signs are discharge from the eyes and nostrils, a rash under the chin and groin and thickening of the footpads. Speak to your vet about when to vaccinate your ferret.

Diarrhoea and green slime disease in ferrets
Diarrhoea can be fatal in ferrets, so make a habit of monitoring your ferrets’ poo every day. Diarrhoea can be caused by changes in diet – but if the diarrhoea is green or black, encourage your ferret to drink plenty and keep an eye on their general wellbeing.
If their poo remains this colour and the texture becomes loose or grainy for more than 24 hours – or you notice other abnormal behaviours, contact your vet straight away. The possible cause is ‘green slime virus’, also known as ECE or epizootic catarrhal enteritis, a very serious and highly contagious illness.
Extreme stress and a build-up of bacteria can bring on this potentially deadly disease. Diarrhoea can bring on dehydration quickly, so make sure your ferrets have easy access to fresh drinking water.
In some cases, your ferret may need admitting to the vets and placing on pain relief and fluids. A quick response really is key to your ferrets surviving this illness, so always seek advice even if they appear fit and well and just have a change in their poo.

Sporadic hair loss in ferrets
It’s quite common for middle-aged ferrets to lose some of their tail hair – the reason for this isn’t completely clear, but it may be related to changes in the seasons. Sporadic hair loss is rarely anything to worry about, and you’ll find the hair grows again naturally within a few months.
You’ll need to consult your vet if symptoms persist or if the hair loss spreads to other parts of the body. Dramatic, widespread or symmetrical hair loss could be a sign of adrenal disease and will require veterinary support.

Adrenal gland disease (AGD) in ferrets
AGD was originally commonly found in the United States. However, it has recently become more common in the UK. Despite several studies, there is yet to be a proven cause of the disease although neutering has been linked in some cases.
Woodgreen are aware of this link and continue to keep up- to-date with the latest information. However, we still recommend neutering to prevent the ever-growing population of unwanted ferrets. Neutering also prevents other serious medical conditions such as anaemia and pyometra.

Symptoms of AGD in ferrets include:

 	Symmetrical hair loss on the rump and flanks, which can cause itching and usually begins in spring. Mild hair loss on the tail is not usually connected to AGD
 	Swollen vulva in neutered females
 	Sexual aggression in both neutered males and females
 	Difficulty urinating, this is more common in males

AGD treatment options for ferrets:
A chemical implant is now available through your vet practice called ‘Suprelorin’ (Virbac Animal Health®). The implant can be used to prevent AGD in neutered ferrets and needs to be repeated every 18-24 months. If your ferret is suspected to have AGD, the implant can be used as a treatment.
The implant can also be used to chemically neuter ferrets as an alternative to surgery. The drug deslorelin has an effect similar to surgical neutering in reducing behaviour problems like fighting and ferret odour – but it will not prevent pregnancy. Clipping your ferrets’ nails
Ferrets’ nails grow continuously, and you will need to clip them every four weeks or so once they are around six months old. If left unclipped, long nails can make walking very uncomfortable and lead to joint and back problems.
Nail clipping is a straightforward task, which is even simpler if someone helps you. One person should hold your ferret in a safe and calm manner and offer ferret paste as a distraction. Using a pair of small animal nail clippers, the other person will use one hand to hold the foot and the other to clip around 1 mm away from the visible blood quick.

Keep an eye on their weight
The average weight for a one-year-old ferret is 1000-1500g for a male, and 800-1500g for a female.
Your ferrets will appear to lose some weight and their coat will thin out in early summer – they will also grow into a slightly chubby ferret at the beginning of winter. This is perfectly normal and a response to the change in temperature. However, it’s important to prevent your ferrets from becoming obese. You should be able to comfortably fit one hand around their armpits when lifting them up.

Dental health in ferrets
Ferrets can be prone to dental decay, particularly if they’re fed a soft meat diet. Monitor your ferrets’ teeth from the age of three years onwards regularly for any signs of infection, unpleasant breath or damaged teeth. Like cats and dogs, ferrets will often require one to two dental check ups by your vet throughout their lifetime.

Lumps, bumps and old age
As your ferrets become elderly at around five to six years of age, they can be prone to a variety of forms of cancer. Often, these appear as lumps on their sides or around the armpits and groin. It is important that you feel over your ferrets’ body weekly for any changes and seek veterinary advice as soon as possible.
Your ferrets will become weaker on their back legs as they approach eight to ten. They may wobble more when they walk, and you may also notice that their hearing and eyesight reduces dramatically. As you start to notice these changes, make sure you adapt their enclosure to suit. Add extra warmth during the winter and bring all sleeping areas and activities down to one level to avoid injuries from falling. Also monitor their eating habits to check they are coping with hard food.

Microchipping your ferrets
Microchipping your ferret is very important. Ferrets are keen escape artists, and many end up in rescue centres as unclaimed strays. They can travel several miles quite quickly, so it may not be your neighbour who finds them!
40% of the ferrets that arrive at our centres are strays. Woodgreen ferrets are microchipped so escapees can quickly be reunited with their owners. If you have homed your ferret from somewhere else, your vet can microchip them for a small fee.         "
How to care for your ferrets in cold or freezing weather,"Ferrets do not like quick changes in temperature because it confuses their internal thermometer. If you’re going to keep your ferrets outside during winter there are plenty of ways to keep them warm instead of bringing them in just at night and putting them out again in the day. This can be in fact, quite dangerous. Only bring them inside if they look poorly and need to see a vet.
Here are some top tips

 	You may want to consider covering the outside of your ferrets’ run and roof with Perspex/clear plastic sheets to keep the wind out, while ensuring good ventilation.
 	Provide them with extra blankets for them to snuggle up in.
 	Make sure their enclosure has plenty of warm and dry hiding places such as boxes, tunnels, cat carriers and hammocks. Fill all hides with some cosy blankets for your ferrets to retreat to when it’s a bit too nippy.
 	During freezing weather, you can use pet safe snuggle pads wrapped in a towel to keep them warm. We wouldn’t recommend filling containers with warm water or hot water bottles as the water inside can freeze quickly.
 	Check their drinking water regularly to make sure it has not frozen over.
 	Your ferrets may like to play in the snow, but ensure you dry them off well with a towel afterwards.
 	Winter usually arrives with nasty colds for pets and people. If you or anyone in your household has one, make sure they keep away from the ferrets, as they can catch it from you.

Companionship
Ferrets thrive in the company of others, especially in winter when they can snuggle up together and keep warm. If you have a ferret at home and looking for a companion for them, we have lots of single ferrets in need of loving new homes and companionship. We may be able to help get them acquainted!          "
How to make your ferrets feel at home,"They also love to climb and explore. Providing your ferrets with lots of fun activities and regularly updating them will help keep your ferrets happy and healthy.

Keep your ferrets happy and occupied
Ferrets are extremely sociable creatures. They need the company of other ferrets to remain happy and content. They enjoy playing rough-and-tumble games and exploring together. In more tranquil moments, they will cuddle up together. By far the most important thing you can give your ferret is a suitable ferret friend.
Make feeding time fun by serving some of your ferrets’ food in Kongs and activity balls and by hiding treats in their bedding and boxes. Searching for their food keeps them occupied – finding it gives them a reward for their work.
Ferrets also love to explore and investigate their surroundings. They love to play, learn and mess around, so make sure you provide them with toys and activities to keep them fit, healthy and happy.

Your ferrets will enjoy:

 	Pipes and tubes for running through or linking to a different part of the enclosure
 	Cat toys such as fishing rods, wands, jingle balls and tall scratching posts
 	Car tyres filled with blankets, shredded paper or sand to dig in
 	Children’s tables and chairs
 	Children’s small tents and tunnels
 	A sandpit
 	Shallow paddling pools with a few plastic balls for them to chase after – use during hot weather to encourage them to keep cool
 	Homemade hammocks made from old bed sheets or jumpers
 	Large paper sacks filled with shredded paper – they love the rustling noises.
 	A cardboard box full of old socks to snuggle in. A great excuse to clean out your sock drawer!
 Choosing the right bedding for your ferrets
The most suitable product to line your ferrets’ floor with is carpet or vinyl. Ferrets are easily litter trained, making the remaining areas easy for you to maintain by sweeping and washing down.
Ferrets like to have their toilet areas in corners or hidden away behind activities and toys. Offer them three to four cat or high-edge corner litter trays to choose from and line these with small shredded paper.
Ferrets can be very inquisitive and ingest some of the litter, so make sure you choose a non-synthetic litter. Place newspaper under and around the litter trays as some ferrets have a habit of missing the tray when backing up into the corner.
Ferrets love nothing more than a cosy bed to snuggle up in. The most suitable option for bedding is soft fleece blankets, old towels or even old jumpers. Place these in card boxes or cat and dog beds, or you can even make a hammock out of old sheets and pile in all the bedding for them to rummage around in.
During the winter, your ferrets will snuggle deep into their blankets. In the summer, they tend to lay on their backs flat out and often go into what’s known as a ‘dead sleep’. This is a very deep sleep that they often don’t fully wake from until you have lifted them up. In most cases, this is very normal. However, if they appear dehydrated, pale or are not responding, seek medical advice immediately.

Cleaning out your ferrets
Keeping your ferret enclosure clean is key to preventing potentially fatal illnesses such as green slime disease. Clean your ferrets’ litter trays or toilet areas and wash them down with pet disinfectant. Carry out a full clean on the whole of the enclosure once a week, ensuring that you also clean all toys, activities and flooring.
Take the opportunity to add a few new toys in the enclosure for interest after each cleaning session.         "
What to feed your chickens,"Your chickens will thrive on a diet of layers pellets combined with mixed corn. They will need access to the food throughout the day, but take it away at night to discourage pests.

Ex-commercial hens are fed a slightly different diet on their farms. If you rehome one directly from the farm, start them on a softer feed known as mash or crumb. You can then gradually wean them on to layers pellets and mixed corn. It’s also a good idea to feed them in a tray for the first few days, since they may not recognise a feeder.

If you notice any of your chickens are not eating, they can be fed ‘crumb’ soaked in water. Boiled potatoes will also help them put on weight.

Chickens’ favourite treats include carrots, corn on the cob, plain popcorn, strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes. Your chickens will love it if you lift a log and let them forage for bugs! Be aware that EU legislation states that it is illegal to feed your chickens kitchen scraps.

Provide your chickens with water in a suitable chicken drinker to prevent it from being knocked over and contaminated. Clean the drinker weekly and give them fresh water daily.
Collecting your chickens’ eggs
Wear gloves when collecting eggs from your chicken. If this is not possible, you should always wash your hands before and after collecting them.

Make sure you don’t wash the eggs – this is part of EU legislation. The eggs have a natural, protective layer on them which helps to keep out bacteria, and washing the eggs removes that.          "
How to house your new chickens,"Chickens are very inquisitive birds and often have their own quirky characters, with many owners regarding them as a part of the family. Here are some tips on how to get your garden or small-holding ready for chickens.

Creating the right environment for your chickens
Your chickens will need a generous outdoor space to allow them to express their natural behaviours. These include digging, scratching, running, stretching up, bathing in dust, roosting and preening. Make sure their environment helps them feel safe and secure, adapts to the seasons and is easy to clean.
Give your chickens a predator-proof run or free-range space in the daytime – but shut them away in a secure coop at night to protect them from predators such as foxes, stoats and rats. Ideally, connect the run and coop or position the coop inside the run.

Coops and runs for chickens
Runs and coops can be purchased or homemade. Either way, it’s important they’re sturdy, safe and secure for your chickens all year round.
Make sure all doors, lids and nest boxes have sturdy bolts on them rather than easy- to-open latches that a predator or young child could open.
Often, low-cost pet shop or internet coops are made with thin, flimsy wood and usually fall apart within a year or so. When choosing your shed or coop, make sure it’s well built, and well ventilated, without allowing the area to become damp.
If your coop and run are wooden, paint them with pet-friendly paint or a safe creosote substitute to deter red mite infestation. These blood-feeding critters live in cracks and crevices in chicken houses.

What size coop do I need for chickens?
The ideal sizes we recommend for a group of three chickens to sleep and move around comfortably are:


 	Coop: Four feet by three feet for three hens
Run: Ideally, chickens should be free-range, but if they need to be in a run, we recommend no less than 10 feet by 5 feet for three birds.

You will need one nest box per hen and enough perches for them all to roost on. These can be long enough for several chickens to be on at once, so you may only need a few.
If your chickens won’t have access to their coop in the day, provide some shade and shelter in their open areas or runs to protect them from the weather. Nest boxes, parasols and garden chairs all provide good shade and shelter. Keep your chickens safe
If your coop and run will be a permanent structure, ensure that the fencing and mesh is dug well into the ground so nothing can dig under. Also make sure it’s high enough so your chickens can’t fly over and escape. Clipping your chickens’ wings will help prevent them escaping.
Placing purpose-designed electric fencing around your chicken area is a good idea if you’re at risk of foxes.

Choosing the right bedding materials for chickens
Using shavings and wheat straw to bed your chickens on is an easy and affordable option. Take care when choosing the right bedding – dusty and fine bedding such as light sawdust can irritate your chickens’ breathing.
Avoid using shredded paper as it can’t be composted in large amounts, and can be very messy. Chicken manure can be used mixed in with your compost heap to make a great plant fertiliser.
Place wood chippings, soil and old dried leaves in cat litter trays for a great activity for your chickens. Chickens love to scratch around looking for tasty worms and bugs. The soil has the added benefit of being used as dust baths by your chickens – this is their natural way of keeping clean and removing parasites.
If you plan to have your run in one place, you may need to consider suitable flooring. Your chickens will dig up the ground and your lovely, green grass will vanish quickly. Rubber, pet-friendly chippings make a perfect base for the run and are also more hygienic compared to bark chippings.

Things to remember:

 	Your chickens will need lots of space, as well as dust baths, scratching trays, nest boxes and perches to keep them occupied
 	Spot clean your accommodation daily, but thoroughly clean it at least once a week – including boxes, trays and perches – to prevent illness and red mite
 	Check nest boxes daily for eggs to prevent your hens getting broody.

Look after your chickens in cold weather,"Chickens naturally live outdoors and spend most of the day in a run or out on the grass looking for tasty bugs to eat. So, spare a thought for our feathered friends when the weather turns and read our top tips on how to prepare for the cold weather.
Top tips

 	Ventilation is very important within coops so make sure any ventilation holes aren’t blocked with bedding.
 	Shelter part of their run and roof with Perspex or clear plastic sheeting while ensuring there’s still good ventilation.
 	Keep water containers in their run to avoid spills in the coop that could freeze over. On cold days, try filling up their drinker with warm water - it will be like having a comforting brew!
 	For a cosy, filling treat, mash up some of your hens’ pellets with warm water.
 	As cute as they may seem, don’t be tempted to put your hens in a chicken jumper. They will struggle to regulate their temperature and the material can easily get hooked on their feet.
 	Chickens don’t like quick changes in temperature, as it confuses their internal thermometer. Don’t bring them indoors into a heated room at night and put them out again during the day. Only bring them inside if they look poorly and need to see a vet.

Cosy coops
There are lots of ways you can cosy-up your chicken’s coop in the winter. Here are a few ideas:

 	Inspect the coop before spells of cold weather and make sure it’s wind and damp-proof.
 	Create cosy spaces for your hens to snuggle up together and sleep – try filling some large cardboard boxes with straw.
 	Featherless ex-caged hens may benefit from a well-fitted heat lamp during cold weather which offers them the choice to keep warm if needed.
 	Top up their bedding daily with a thick layer of wood shavings on the floor and ample amounts of straw in nesting areas to keep the warmth in.

Beware of bumblefoot
Bumblefoot is a bacterial infection that occurs on the feet of birds, rodents and rabbits. It’s caused by an infected wound or by being kept on damp bedding or the ground. Prolonged exposure to this can damage the feet and allows nasty bacteria to find it’s way onto the foot. It’s worth moving them onto a concrete surface or regularly layering the floor with clean, dry straw to help prevent health issues including bumblefoot.          "
An introduction to chickens,"Chickens are an increasingly popular pet to keep in back gardens, with them easily becoming very tame and part of the family. Chickens are perfect for all ages to enjoy, ex-commercial hens are especially rewarding as you can watch them grow and develop into healthy birds, with many owners regarding their chickens as a part of the family.
There are many things to consider when taking on chickens, these fast facts will provide you with some basic information to help you decide if chickens are for you.

Fast facts
Chicken companionship
Chickens need to live with at least two other chickens, the best mix is a trio or more hens or a cockerel with two or more hens.

Life expectancy of chickens
Chickens can live for 4-12 years depending on the breed.

Accommodation for chickens
Chickens need lots of space to keep them fit, healthy and happy, the ideal size should consist of:


 	A 4ft by 3ft (121cm by 91cm) or bigger coop with nest boxes for three medium chickens.
 	If unable to free range, then attached to the coop a 10ft long by 5ft wide (305cm by 152cm) run attached for daytime exploring.

Food for chickens
Layers pellets with corn and vegetables as treats. They will also enjoy piles of logs in their enclosure for them to ‘bug hunt’. Fresh water should be available all day alongside a bowl of grit/oyster shell to aid digestion.

Chicken health
Chickens require worming every three months, a weekly inspection for common mites and lice should also be carried out. Chickens can sometimes have complications with producing eggs or problems with their crop, so it is wise to research into common health concerns.

Are chickens family-friendly?
Chickens can make an excellent addition to any family with all ages, they can become very friendly and enjoy following you round the garden and even popping in the house. Care should be taken with introductions around predator species such as cats and dogs.          "
How many rabbits should you keep?,"Many rabbits who live a life on their own will display behaviours that indicate they’re unhappy and stressed. These include:


 	Hiding away, ‘being lazy’ and showing little interest in their environment
 	Sitting huddled in a corner or in a hide
 	Being very still with their nose twitching fast when being handled
 	Screaming when handled
 	Attacking their owner, grunting, boxing &amp; biting when the owner is in their territory
 	Destructive behaviour in their accommodation

The ideal combination of rabbits is a neutered male and neutered female rabbit. Try to match their ages as closely as possible to make sure their behaviour and mobility is equally matched.
You can bond different breeds together, although take care when considering a giant with a smaller breed. While many mismatched-size pairings work, there’s always a risk to the smaller rabbit during the mixing process.
Same-sex pairs can work, but it’s important they’re neutered as early as possible – ideally between four to six months – to prevent potentially fatal fights as they mature. If your rabbits have started fighting, neutering them and slowly introducing them back together may resolve it. However, often the rabbits are unable to move on from disliking each other.  Bonding a lone rabbit with another rabbit
If you find yourself with a lone rabbit of any age, contact your local rescue centre to help find your rabbit a companion.
First, make sure both rabbits are neutered. This not only prevents unwanted litters of rabbits but also help them bond with each other. If one or both rabbits aren’t neutered, they will often fight quite aggressively once mature. They may also regularly try to mount the neutered rabbit, which can result in arguments. Both rabbits should have recovered from their operations and be in good health before starting bonding.

Preparing for bonding your rabbits
When introducing rabbits, it is very important that this is carried out in neutral territory. At Woodgreen, we offer a mixing service where your rabbit can come and stay at the centre and be mixed in neutral territory under the watchful eye of an experienced member of the team. If you’re not able to visit the centre, make your area as neutral as possible. This can be done by:


 	Buying a new enclosure
 	Deep cleaning existing accommodation and making as many changes as possible
 	Moving the run onto a new patch of grass or onto concrete
 	Adding in new fruit tree logs, piles of fresh hay and large empty cardboard boxes
 	Adding lots of tasty, interesting forage, such as bramble, for the rabbits to mutually feed on

Don’t use small spaces, hides, tunnels or small hutches to avoid the rabbits becoming cornered and provoking a fight. Spaces that are nice and open, around 10ft in length, but not too big are best.

Not all introductions are fast-paced. Your chosen area to mix will need to be uninterrupted for at least a week whilst your rabbits build a bond. The area needs to be safe from predators and not an area you need to use like a bathroom or kitchen.
Starting the bonding process
Once you feel the rabbits and the accommodation are ready, you can start the mix. Make sure you have a towel ready to step in and separate them should a serious fight start. Always wear suitable footwear and clothing to avoid any injuries to yourself.

Place the rabbits down into the run at the exact same time, remove the carriers and step back to observe. Start the process when you’re able to monitor closely for several days like the weekend.
Positive behaviours in the first few hours to three days include:

 	Chasing but quickly losing interest
 	Mounting
 	Gentle fur pulling
 	Grooming each other’s faces
 	Indifference when they walk past each other

By the end of the first day, it’s common to see:
Rabbits sitting calmly at opposite ends of the accommodation, grooming themselves or feeding. This is an encouraging sign – your rabbits are relaxed in each other’s company.
By day two or three, you will hopefully see:
Your rabbits sitting close together and grooming each other. This shows their bond is building nicely, and they may be ready to move into their permanent home in a few days.

When settling a newly bonded pair into their forever home, place some of the old hay from the mixing area into the hutch and run to help keep the ‘bonded smell.’
Signs your rabbits may not be suited
However, not all mixes are successful. Signs of hostility between two rabbits are obvious and dramatic and may include:

 	Charging at the other rabbit with ears flat against the body
 	One of the rabbits actively seeking out the other rabbit and inciting a fight
 	Standing up and boxing each other
 	Biting each other’s backs causing fur to fly everywhere
 	Kicking each other’s stomachs
 	Biting that results in high-pitched screams

If these behaviours are seen on the first or start of the second day, you should separate the rabbits, as this mix is unlikely to work. Give both rabbits a full health check, looking for any fight wounds or injuries to their legs. Contact a rabbit-friendly vet if you’re concerned.
Consider a ‘split mix’
In some cases, it may be more suitable to do a ‘split mix’ over a period of one to two weeks. This will give a higher success rate if one or both of your rabbits have a history of being aggressive towards other rabbits.

A split mix is where you have a mesh divider in the accommodation with each rabbit living on either side. Every day, you swap their semi-clean litter trays over and place their water and litter trays next to the wire to encourage a slow bond. Once they appear nice and relaxed with each other, you can go on to a neutral mix where they are placed in together.
Can a rabbit and a guinea pig live together?
Although some owners have found a rabbit and guinea pig to live seemingly happily together, there is a big risk that the guinea pig will be accidentally kicked when the rabbit is running and hopping about.

Guinea pigs also communicate through sounds and a variety of body movements – it’s their way to communicate danger, anger, happiness and food availability. Rabbits use very little vocal noises other than to indicate severe pain and distress. It can be extremely distressing for a rabbit to have to keep listening to a guinea pig squeaking and for a guinea pig to live its life in silence without communication.

Rabbits and guinea pigs also have very different accommodation needs. Living together can mean that one or both are living in unsuitable enclosures.        "
Why rabbits need vaccinating,"Not only do rabbit vaccinations protect your bunnies from severe diseases, it stops them from passing it on to other rabbits. It’s recommended to give your rabbits their first vaccinations at around five to seven weeks old. PDSA have a useful rabbit vaccination schedule which reminds you when to book them in for a booster.

So, do rabbits need vaccinations?
Yes! Rabbits require a booster injection every year to protect them from the three life-threatening rabbit diseases; Myxomatosis, Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease-1 and Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease-2. The vaccine was developed in 2020 and it’s called ‘Nobivac myxo-RHD plus’. It offers protection against all three diseases for 12 months within three weeks of the vaccine being administered. Find out more about each disease and the signs to look out for below.
Myxomatosis
Myxomatosis is probably the most commonly known disease is myxomatosis in rabbits. It’s a severe viral disease which isspread by fleas and mosquitoes. Both wild rabbits and indoor and outdoor pet rabbits are at risk.

Signs include:

 	Swollen, puffy eyes
 	Small lumps all over the ears spread down the body
 	Breathing problems
 	Sitting hunched and fluffed
 	Eyes shut with a glue-like appearance.

In most cases, once myxomatosis takes hold, an unvaccinated rabbit is sadly unlikely to survive and may have to suffer for up to two weeks until they pass away. Upon diagnosis of the disease, the kindest option is to consider putting them to sleep to prevent further suffering. A vet can support you with this difficult decision. Even vaccinated rabbits can get Myxomatosis, but they will experience mild symptoms and have a much greater chance of survival. Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease 1 and 2
The other disease to be aware of is Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic disease of which there are two strains known as  RVHD1 and RVHD2 (Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease 1 and 2).

The primary strain in the UK was RVHD1 until a new strain appeared in 2013 and in 2015, it really took hold and RVHD2 is now one of the biggest killers in pet rabbits, and a large contributor in the decline in wild rabbits. RVHD is a very tricky to spot because it  shows little symptoms other than sudden death. RVHD spores can be transferred from infected animals onto clothing, footwear, bedding etc, so it’s possible to be unknowingly in contact with it.

If your rabbit sadly passes away suddenly with no obvious reason, it is recommended to agree to have a post-mortem carried out by your vet. Positive results can then be documented to aid the tracking of the virus’ movements.
Signs include:
Sadly, there aren’t any warning signs prior to your rabbit passing away with RVHD, it can be very sudden. The following symptoms will be quickly followed by death.

 	Jaundice (yellowing of the skin)
 	Sudden collapse
 	Severve diarrhoea
 	Loud scream.

Preparing your rabbits for a vet visit
If you need to take your rabbits to the vet for a check-up or for their vaccinations, set up a travel carrier with some hay from their accommodation along with fresh forage or vegetables. Ideally, choose a vet that specialises in rabbits to ensure a smooth visit. If possible, take a small towel for your rabbits to sit on during their visit to help them feel comfortable and secure when sitting on the table. Once they’ve had their jabs,   take them straight home and leave them to settle back into their enclosure and reward them with a tasty treat.

How to care for older cats,"An older cat requires less supervision than a young cat, their energy levels are much lower and they already have experience of home life. Individual cats will have their own personality, but in general older cats tend to be more homely and relaxed. They can still be playful and enjoy going outside, but this is often less frequent than a younger cat.

Older cats can be a real pleasure to care for. They can make wonderful companions who really enjoy their home comforts, and you won't need to worry about them using your curtains as a climbing frame or training them to use the litter tray.
Insurance for older cats
Consider whether you will insure your older cat. Most cats will experience some type of medical issue in their lifetime, many of which are related to old age. Think about how you will pay for veterinary care, can you afford it without insurance?

Most insurers will not allow a new policy to be taken out on a cat aged over eight years. We work with Petplan Charity cover, which will insure any aged cat rehomed with Woodgreen, from six weeks old to 22 years old. You receive four weeks’ free cover and then have the opportunity to extend this.

You should take your cat for regular OAP checks at your local vet– they will be able to monitor your cat’s physical health. We recommend routine blood tests for cats over the age of ten as well as regular blood pressure checks. This can help pick up early signs of any illness.

Some of the most common signs of illness are listed below, please consult your vet if you spot any of the signs listed below:

 	Increased drinking
 	Increase or decrease in appetite
 	Sudden weight loss
 	Stiffness or difficulty with moving around and jumping
 	Lack of hearing or sight
 	Loose or very dry faeces
 	Erratic or very lethargic behaviour
 	Lack of grooming
 	Change in levels of vocalisation and communication
 	Episodes of confusion

Keep an eye on your older cat
Most cats will suffer from age related illnesses such as kidney failure or hyperthyroidism. These are often misdiagnosed by owners, who put the symptoms down to old age. Keep an eye out for the symptoms – usually an increase or decrease in normal behaviours, such as eating, tolerance levels, urinating, drinking or grooming.

If you spot these types of conditions early enough, they can be managed responsibly and you and your cat can extra years of happy life together.

Treat your cat regularly with flea and worm products from the vet – they are still at the same risk of parasites even if they spend more time inside than out. You should also keep a close eye on your cat’s claws, they may struggle to keep their claws from growing too long and you may need to clip them regularly.

Older cats tend to thrive on routine and consistency in the home. They may have a lower tolerance of routine change and may become less adaptable as they age; if they do become short tempered on a regular basis you should consult a vet as it can be sign of stress or illness.
Looking after your older cat’s teeth
Older cats are prone to dental problems and need their teeth checked regularly. Your vet can advise you about dental care on a regular basis to help protect your cat’s teeth in the future. There are many products you can use to keep your cat’s teeth clean – including toothpaste, dental biscuits and seaweed plaque treatments. If you keep your cat’s teeth in good condition then you can avoid the need for regular dental treatment under anaesthetic, where the vet will clean and possibly remove teeth.
Adapting your home for your older cat
As cats begin to get older its fairly common for them to start showing signs of arthritis. It may be more difficult for them to get around by jumping and climbing. Creating steps and graduated levels to reach areas can make this much easier for them. It will also help prevent them causing an injury.

You may also find that they are more reluctant to go outside, or that they don’t venture as far. This is normal behaviour for an older cat, but it’s always worth providing lots of shaded areas in the summer and secluded areas that they can relax in if they wish. Some older cats will find it difficult to negotiate the cat flap as they may have done previously and alternative options to outside will be required.
Feeding areas
For many cats, it can be uncomfortable to lean down to get to their food and water bowls. Especially as they get a little older. For this reason, we would suggest having these items raised off the floor slightly to enable them to eat at a more comfortable, natural level.
Litter trays
As our feline friends get older, they may find it more difficult to climb in and out of the litter tray. They may also find it uncomfortable to squat down as they used to. For these reasons we suggest looking at a tray with a low entry point for easy access and raised sides to help keep everything in the tray. Remember, litter trays should be a suitable size for them to stand up and easily turn around in.
Play
Despite their age, it’s important to allow your older cat access to toys for whenever they fancy having a play. Although it may not always happen, when they do it’s likely going to be at a steady pace and far less energetic, however they will still have their typical instincts.
Maintaining their ideal weight
Due to the likelihood of them living a much more laid back and relaxed lifestyle as they age, it’s important to make sure they are staying within a healthy weight bracket. Take a look at how to manage their health here.

There is never a shortage of older cats at our rehoming centres looking for a new place to call their own, with many years of life left to enjoy.

Unfortunately, older cats are more difficult to rehome. But by offering one of our senior residents a loving new home you will be making a personal contribution to animal welfare. Take a look at all of our older cats currently looking for homes.

Multi-cat homes: what to think about,"Although this is a very generous thing to do, it is also important to think about your existing cat’s needs and wellbeing before considering the introduction of a new cat.
Cats are solitary hunters by nature and do not naturally live in structured social groups. However, they’re also very adaptable and having more than one unrelated cat in the same household can and often does work. Each cat will need their own space, so it’s a good idea to consider the following before bringing another cat into your family:


 	the size of property that you have, and the space available to each individual cat
 	the amount of cats living in your neighbourhood
 	whether the cats are related
 	their age, gender and temperament
 	their previous experience with other cats

Are the cats related?
Cats usually get on best within a related group, for example mum and kittens or siblings from the same litter.  The dynamics of a multi-cat household or a large group of unrelated cats are constantly changing. In a home with many cats, some cats may form smaller groups within the household and try to avoid the other cats.

Think about your cats’ resources
Cats will compete for resources that are essential for them to survive and thrive – water, food, toileting areas, high resting places, scratching facilities, places to enter and exit rooms, places to hide, toys, and social time with their humans. If a group of cats needs to share these resources, it will almost certainly encourage disputes between different cats, and arguments will cause high anxiety levels.
The cats’ emotional welfare is the most important thing, so with a little time, effort and money you can change your home environment to give your cats the resources they need. The benefits of this are:


 	Fewer parasites such as worms and fleas, and a slower spread if a cat does become infected
 	Less transmission of diseases between the cats
 	Less fighting
 	Fewer medical issues relating to stress, like urinary retention, constipation, over-grooming or eating disorders
 	Cats with a more relaxed temperament who are easier to look after
 	Cats who are less likely to redirect their aggression (e.g. attacking you) or develop unwanted behavioural problems
 	Cats who feel less pressured to mark out their territory – so they are less likely to spray, urinate and defecate in inappropriate places

How to provide enough food and water
There should be one food bowl per cat in the household, and each cat’s feeding area should be in a separate part of the house. Cats are solitary hunters and like to eat alone.
Provide a separate water bowl for each cat, plus one extra, and place these in different areas around the house. The water bowls should be away from the food and litter trays as cats do not like to drink water near to where they have eaten or toileted. They may also stop drinking altogether if another cat is stopping their access to water.  Try to position the water bowls so that your cats can drink from any side of it – so they can see if another cat is approaching.

How many litter trays?
Like water bowls, the general rule for litter trays is one per cat plus one extra. Even if your cats don’t use the extra tray, it is always worth having it just in case. Some cats may block another cat’s access to a litter tray, so providing slightly more than they need may help prevent this.
You can use covered litter trays and open litter trays, and a variety of different types of litter. We would recommend a transparent covered tray – that way your cat has some protection but also has a clear view of what’s coming. Remember to put litter trays in quiet areas of the house, away from full length windows, doorways and cat flaps. They should also be placed well away from each other, but make sure that they are easily accessible.

High resting places
Providing a variety of high resting places around the house can give each cat their own place to observe their territory from up high. Cats seek high up areas when they feel anxious, so make sure these resting areas are well above the ground and provide a way for older, less agile cats to get to them.
Suitable places may be shelves, bookcases, tops of wardrobes or cupboards, or tall scratching posts with a platform at the top. Try not to draw attention to your cat if they’re in a high resting place, as they may want to stay inconspicuous.

The importance of scratching posts
Scratching is a natural behaviour for a cat and also gives them a way to mark their territory, both visually and with the scent glands between the pads in their paws. Scratching is an alternative to spraying for marking a cat’s territory, so the more scratching posts you have, especially at entrances and exits within the home and near beds, the less likely your cats are to spray.
Scratching posts are also necessary for your cats’ health – scratching conditions their claws and provides exercise. You can provide a range of different scratching areas, both vertical and horizontal, and these needn’t cost a lot of money. Carpet samples, doormats, disposable cardboard scratchers and standard post scratchers are all equally suitable.
Place the scratching devices in prominent areas, usually entrances and exits to each room. A scratching post will not be used if it is tucked away. Make sure they’re sturdy enough to take your cat’s weight and that some of the scratchers are tall enough for your cats to really stretch up while they scratch. You can encourage your cats to use the scratching areas by placing dry catnip on them.          "
Neutering your cat: what you need to know,"Many people worry that neutering their pet is not natural, but it is worth remembering that keep a domesticated pet isn’t a natural situation.

Neutering helps control the cat population
Cats have the potential to get pregnant again immediately after giving birth, in fact one un-neutered female cat can be responsible for 20,000 kittens in just five years (source - Cats Protection). It’s a myth that all female cats should have at least one litter.

Neutering helps cat behaviour
Unneutered female cats will call regularly and will attract males. Unneutered male cats are likely to stray over a large area, mark their territory and are much more likely to fight. They will wander from home and may not return. Unneutered males may also spray inside the home and be aggressive to their owners.

Neutering is good for your cat’s health
Female cats who are not neutered are more likely to suffer from pyometra later in life. Mothers with infectious diseases may pass these on to their kittens. Pregnancy and birth are also not without risk.
Fighting males are much more likely to spread diseases such as FIV and FeLV to other cats. They are also likely to suffer from fight injuries such as abscesses. Because they wander over a large area they are also at greater risk of suffering road traffic accidents.
Also, unwanted kittens may not be cared for and are likely to suffer from various infectious diseases such as cat flu.

When to neuter your cat
Your cat should be neutered by four months of age. It is important to neuter female cats before the first season in order to keep the cat population under control.
Historically there have been concerns about neutering younger than six months, however modern veterinary techniques have reduced the risks of operating on young kittens, and studies into growth and development show no problems in neutering cats before puberty.

Care after cat neutering

 	You will probably see some redness, swelling and bruising around your cat’s scrotum and incision wounds after the operation. The scrotum will not shrink as soon as the testicles are removed, it will take time to reduce in size
 	Look for excessive, dark purple bruising or hardened swelling
 	In a routine cat castration, it is standard procedure to allow the incision wounds to heal by themselves.

If your cat has had an operation and you’re concerned about anything, contact your vet immediately.

Cat neutering costs and help available

 	It costs around £60 to spay a female cat and £40 to castrate a male cat
 	Help with neutering costs may be available for certain people on low incomes from Woodgreen, Cats Protection, RSPCA, PDSA, Blue Cross
 	Find your nearest veterinary surgery offering neutering

Understanding your cat," Balancing your cat's mood state
Helping to balance your cats mood state by providing them with all the essential needs will have a significant effect on their welfare. Learning what your cat likes and reading their body language will help you to see what emotion your cat is feeling and how best to help them.
Remember, cats can feel a variety of emotions such as joy, fear, anxiety, sadness, affection, frustration and anger. There is currently no evidence to show that cats can feel shame, guilt or spite. Therefore, punishing your cat by shouting is only likely to cause them fear.
There are much better ways to help when it comes to dealing with unwanted behaviours or making your cat happy, starting with the following.

Think about your cat's resources
Cats will compete for resources that are essential for them to survive and thrive – water, food, toileting areas, high resting places, scratching facilities, places to enter and exit rooms, places to hide, toys, and social time with their humans. If a group of cats needs to share these resources, it will almost certainly encourage disputes between different cats, and arguments will cause high anxiety levels.
The cats’ emotional welfare is the most important thing, so with a little time, effort and money you can change your home environment to give your cats the resources they need. The benefits of this are:


 	Fewer parasites such as worms and fleas, and a slower spread if a cat does become infected
 	Less transmission of diseases between the cats
 	Less fighting
 	Fewer medical issues relating to stress, like urinary retention, constipation, over-grooming or eating disorders
 	Cats with a more relaxed temperament who are easier to look after
 	Cats who are less likely to redirect their aggression (e.g. attacking you) or develop unwanted behavioural problems
 	Cats who feel less pressured to mark out their territory – so they are less likely to spray, urinate and defecate in inappropriate places

Relaxation and sleep
Quite often, cats like places out of the way or high up. On top of the fridge or underneath a chair are often favourites, so they’re well protected and undisturbed whilst they sleep. Provide your cat with a nice comfy bed in the areas of their choice. Also consider cat beds that incorporate perch and hide opportunities, like radiator or covered beds.
There are also complimentary products available which can relax cats, relieve their anxiety and help them get along together. Feline diffusers can help your cat feel more relaxed in the home, some are specifically designed to help improve relationships between cats. Cat anxiety remedies, available in tablets or as supplements, can take the edge off any anxious feelings your cat may have.

The importance of hiding and perching
Your cat should have the option to hide and perch. Give them an upturned sturdy cardboard box (big enough for your cat to lie in, turn around in and sit on top of), a chair with a large towel draped over it, or similar items in your home. If possible, there should be hiding and perching options in all rooms and floors of your cat’s home.
If your cat chooses to go to these places, especially if worried, they should be left to hide until they are ready to come out by themselves.

Jumping and climbing
All cats should have the opportunity to climb and jump up high. You could use tree branches for ramps, provide platforms and sturdy cardboard boxes, tall scratching posts and even let them explore shelving – minus the ornaments, of course.

Playing, hunting and mental stimulation
Encourage your cat to play with toys and rotate them regularly to prevent over-familiarity and boredom. Use toys that emulate the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat. If your cat likes to play predatory games, then play with them at various times throughout day with a suitable toy. This means your cat can express their natural hunting behaviours. Some examples of predatory toys to mentally stimulate your cat are:


 	String toys
 	Feather toys
 	Ping pong balls
 	Cat nip toys
 	Stalking toys

Is your cat talking to you?
Cats will meow to communicate with their owners. You may even notice they have a different meow for different things they want from you. Getting to know the different sounds and ways of interacting with you will help you to notice if there are any changes in your cat that may indicate they are unhappy or unwell.
When playing with your cat, remember to give a food reward to finish off the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat.  Avoid any toys (like laser pens) that do not allow your cat to follow this natural hunting sequence, as this can cause your cat to get frustrated and redirect this frustration on to you. If you do use one of these toys, finish the game by offering a toy for your cat to ‘kill' and a tasty treat afterwards.

How to spot if your cat is unwell
Your cat may not always clearly let you know if they’re in pain or unwell. Look out for these subtle signs:


 	Lethargic
 	Restless
 	Not eating or eating less
 	Excessive drinking
 	Keeping to themselves, not wanting to be fussed
 	Out of the ordinary behaviour

If you have any concerns about the health of your cat, consult your vet immediately.

Regular checks keep your cat healthy
Take your cat for regular check-ups at the vets for general body condition, weight and teeth. Groom them regularly to keep their coat in good condition and strengthen their bond with you – this is especially for long haired cats. Remember to keep an eye on your cat’s weight and feed them the right diet to keep their teeth healthy.

Are cat harnesses and leads okay to use?,"There may be a perfectly valid reason why you’re concerned about your cat exploring the great outdoors:

 	You might live near a busy road
 	Neighbouring dogs may spook your feline friend
 	Perhaps your cat is nervous and you’re worried about them going missing or being stolen
 	You don’t want your cat to be hunting birds in the garden.

Because of these reasons, you may be looking for a way to allow them outside while keeping them safe. This is often when a harness or lead might be considered.

&nbsp;
How to put a harness on a cat
All cats have their own personalities and behaviours, some may tolerate wearing a harness, other won’t. Even when this has been tried from a young age. Generally, you may find cats are more reluctant to wear a harness or a lead. Some of the risks mentioned below would suggest it’s not safe to harness train your cat, no matter how tolerant they are.

&nbsp;
How might a harness or lead affect a cat’s natural instincts?
When considering your cat’s natural instincts and responses, the use of a harness could potentially be a very scary and stressful piece of equipment for them.
Fight or flight
Cats are naturally a flight animal. They have a built-in response to run away from danger and to hide in a safe place, usually up a tree, or back into the home where they feel safe. Use of a harness would take this natural reaction away from them, causing them to become stressed and unhappy. This might have negative repercussions with being outside or towards the owner who is holding the lead.
Hunting
Another natural instinct of your cat is to hunt. Many owners are aware of this, they might not be too keen on it, but know it will happen. Some may try to prevent this by introducing a harness and lead.  This may cause issues similar to the behaviours we see from indoor only cats, this can be very frustrating for them and in turn, could cause aggressive type behaviours towards you or others in the home, including pets.

Risks of using a cat harness or lead
There’s a risk you’ll lose your grip when using a harness or lead because there’s a chance your cat might try to escape and result in them becoming caught. Given that cats like to climb, this could be a very dangerous situation.

It’s important to consider your cat’s overall wellbeing, even if they appear willing to wear a harness or lead, doesn’t mean they’re necessarily happy about it. Especially when they’re outside wanting to play and hunt.

By taking your cat or kitten outside wearing a harness will allow them to experience a few sights and sounds while keeping them close to you. However, they won’t be able to enjoy the experience of roaming freely, while hunting and playing as they really wish to. Socialising your kitten is really important, it’s a vital part of their development. Restricting them may lead to unwanted behavioural issues.

&nbsp;
Providing a suitable outdoor space for your cat
If you’re still concerned about letting your cat out without a harness or lead, there are several things you can do to ease your worries. We have plenty of tips on making your garden safe for your cat.

What to do about your cat's scratching,"Scratching is also an effective way for your cat to mark their territory and exercises the muscles of the forelimbs and spine, keeping them in top hunting condition. Some cats even scratch by lying down and pull their bodyweight along the floor.

What do cats like to scratch?
Cats scratch in the home if they have limited or no access to outdoors, or if they simply prefer to spend more time indoors.
Popular indoor scratching surfaces include soft woods like pine, fabrics, textured wallpaper and carpet. Popular locations include door mats, doorframes, stairs and furniture.

Why is my cat scratching?
Whether your cat’s scratching is for claw maintenance, territory marking or both depends on the dynamics of the household or neighbourhood, the amount of scratching and the pattern of locations, plus other factors.
If you notice your cat scratching excessively throughout your home, particularly around doorways and windows, this may indicate your cat is feeling insecure. Products such as ‘Feliway’ or ‘Feliway Friends’ can be used to calm your cat down – the latter is specifically designed for inter-cat conflict. If you’re worried your cat is over-anxious, contact your vet for advice.

How do I stop my cat damaging my furniture?
Make sure you provide your cat with scratching posts and other scratching facilities indoors to avoid damage to carpet, wallpaper or furniture. Trimming your cat’s claws short is not an ethical answer to deter scratching and neither is punishing them. Both may make your cat feel even more insecure.
If your cat is damaging a particular surface or object, try providing an alternative that offers them a similar experience. For example, if your cat is scratching the corner of your sofa, then the alternative scratching area should be sturdy and vertical with similar texture and height. If your cat grips a step on your staircase, provide them with vertical and horizontal scratching surfaces.
Place sheets of laminated card or low tack double-sided adhesive tape over damaged areas of furniture to discourage your cat from scratching them - cats don’t like to scratch these surfaces. Laminated card will also protect your furniture from further damage.
Place a scratching post near to the damaged furniture, this will appear more attractive than the slippery surface of the card or tape. When you’re certain your cat has taken to their new scratching post, remove the laminated card.
The same technique can be used if your cat scratches the lower step of your staircase. and scratch horizontally whilst lying down. Make sure you warn everyone in your house if you place laminated card on stairs, as this can be a slippery and cause accidents.

What cat scratching post should I buy?
Commercially available cat scratching posts range from a basic single post to floor-to-ceiling activity centres or cat trees. Cat trees provide your cat with opportunities for play, exercise and rest, as well as hiding places and a variety of surfaces to scratch. Invest in a sturdy one – cats will seldom use something too flimsy.
Avoid buying a scratching post specifically designed for kittens. These posts don’t stay tall enough or sturdy enough for very long, as your kitten grows.
In households of two or more cats, you’ll need at least one scratching post per cat plus an additional one - all positioned in different locations.

How do I encourage my cat to use a scratching area?
Some posts are already laced with catnip, designed to encourage your cat to use them. You can also offer predatory toys like a wand toy or feather for your cat to chase around base. This will encourage your cat’s claws to make contact with surface and this is often enough to ensure they continue to use the post.
Sprinkling some tasty dry food on the post will often be enough to encourage your cat to use it. There’s also a synthetic pheromone product called ‘Feliscratch’ which can be used. This is specifically designed to attract your cat to scratch the scratching post.
If space is an issue, you can attach scratching panels to the walls - these can be commercial or home-made from sisal, bark or corrugated cardboard. Position them to allow your cat to scratch at full stretch.          "
What to do if your cat goes missing,"
 	Immediately report your missing cat to as many animal welfare organisations, and animal reunite websites as possible. Many people leave it for a couple of weeks before reporting a missing cat, but your cat could have already been brought into a rehoming centre and rehomed in this time. If no microchip is found, rehoming centres are not required by law to keep a cat for any longer than seven days, before finding it a new home
 	Ask your neighbours to check their sheds, gardens, garages or greenhouses for signs of your cat if safe to do so. Give them a full description of your cat, and a photograph if possible
 	Put up posters with vital contact details, a photo and go door to door to find out if there have been any sightings of your cat
 	If there are no sightings of your cat, report it missing to www.animalsearchuk.co.uk
 	If your cat is microchipped, inform the microchip company, this is usually Petlog. Ensure that you update any information that may have changed and tell them your cat is missing, please have your cat’s microchip number to hand before ringing.

How to care for your cat in the cold winter months,"From keeping your cat’s bed away from draughts, to ensuring they have spare litter trays inside so they don’t have to venture out into the cold, we have lots of top tips on how to care for your cat in the cold winter months.
Top tips

 	Provide a cosy bed for your cat – igloo style and radiator beds are very popular with fussy felines.
 	If there’s been heavy snow, check the cat flap and make sure it’s not blocked.
 	Provide extra indoor entertainment for days when your cat just doesn’t want to go outside.
 	For brave cats who still want to explore the garden, create a sheltered area outside so they can still keep warm.
 	Check garden sheds and garages before locking up at night. These are less likely to be opened as often as they are in the summer months. Cats often seek covered outbuildings to shield from the cold.
 	For outdoor cats, make sure they have access to a fresh, flowing water source.

Things to consider
Just like us, it’s natural to spend more time indoors during the winter months and the same goes for cats. Some just want to stay indoors where it’s warm and cosy. We have lots of things to keep us amused, so it’s worth providing things to keep your cat entertained too!

 	Scatter a few more toys around the home to keep your cat busy too. This will prevent them from getting bored and displaying tricky behaviours.
 	The best toys for the job are ones that mimic the chase, catch and kill cycle, just ensure they have a real treat at the end to keep them happy.

Some cats will be so comfortable indoors that they don’t want to go outside to do their business.

 	Always make sure they have access to a litter tray indoors.
 	Place this away from any draughts and if you have more than one cat, provide one each and a spare in case both litter trays have been used. This will prevent any accidents in the home.

Cats that live outside may need support with their diet over winter. There will be less to hunt so here are a few things you can do:

 	Leave out a little extra food for them to give them the calories they need to keep warm.
 	Try not to treat them too much though or your risk over-feeding them.

Beware of toxic substances
On those icy days when you need to top up your car with antifreeze, make sure you mop up any spillages and firmly tighten the lids of the bottles. Antifreeze is highly toxic to pets including cats and they’re attracted to its sweet taste and aroma. If you think your cat may have consumed antifreeze, contact your vet immediately.

Check your cat’s paws if they’ve been out and about in the day time. Although many will walk on grass and venture into wooden areas, salt and grit used on pavements in urban areas can cause sores.          "
How to train your cat to enter a carrier,"If your cat’s had a bad experience with a carrier - and most cats consider any trip to the vets a bad experience - you’ll find it difficult or even impossible to get them in the carrier. They may run, hide or become aggressive and may feel stressed when they’re finally inside.
Cat carriers are important and useful, so it’s worth training your cat to make the experience as stress-free as possible.

Choosing the right carrier for your cat
Before starting training, make sure you have the right carrier. Look for one that's secure, with plenty of space for your cat to stand up, turn around, sit and lay down in – but not so big they feel overwhelmed.
The carrier should be made of easy to clean materials, such as plastic - wood, cardboard, fabric and wicker carriers can be difficult to keep clean. It should be easy to enter and exit. A carrier with a door at the front so your cat can voluntarily walk in, and a lid on top so your cat can be carefully lifted out at the vets would be the best option.
Some carriers have clips securing the top of the carrier to the bottom - these can be extra handy for cats that are very nervous at the vets. The vet can take the top off the carrier and leave your cat in the bottom of the carrier, so they feel like they have some protection. These carriers are also perfect for training.
Try to choose a lightweight carrier – some can become extremely heavy when they have a cat inside. If you have more than one cat, each should have their own carrier. No matter how close your cats are normally, when they’re stressed and confined in a carrier they may redirect that stress on to each other and fight.

How to train your cat to get into the carrier
Teaching your cat to enter their carrier is a step-by-step process. If they haven’t already had an experience with a carrier, you can complete many of these steps in just one or two training sessions. If your cat is already frightened of the carrier, the training may take several weeks.
Throughout the training process, you’ll know your cat is ready for the next step when they’re calm and accepting of the step you’re working on. Training cats takes patience and empathy, so make sure you don’t rush through the steps. Keep these key rules in mind:


 	Do your training between vet visits and when you don’t need to transport your cat. You’ll be gently and gradually teaching them to associate the carrier with pleasant experiences, so it’s vital they don’t experience any fear or stress around or inside it during the training period. If they do, teaching them to accept the carrier will be much more challenging, if not impossible
 	Keep all background noise and movement to a minimum while you’re training. Cats have an acute sense of hearing and smell, so things we don’t notice could startle or scare them. This could be doors slamming, washing machines or tumble driers on spin cycle, an alarm on the oven, other pets or strong smelling cleaning products. If they get scared while you’re training it can undo all your hard work
 	Always use tasty treats as a reward for desired behaviours. All cats have at least one tasty food treat that motivates them - this can be anything from commercial cat treats to a small pinch of smelly fish, like tuna. Try finding one treat your cat finds tasty and another they find extremely tasty! This way you can increase the reward value to your cat by using the extremely tasty treat when the training becomes more intense.

Step 1: getting used to the cat carrier
The first step is to teach your cat to be comfortable and relaxed just being near the carrier before you try to train them to enter it.
If your cat is really frightened at the sight of the carrier, or panics when they know you’re going to the cupboard where you keep the carrier, then get them used to something else first. The best way to start is feeding them treats on a blanket or towel on the floor of the room where you plan to do the carrier training. Do this for a few days without any sign of the carrier in the room.
Once your cat is comfortable with this, place the carrier in an open space in the same room before they enter. If you carrier has clips that fasten the top to the bottom, take the top off and introduce the bottom half of the carrier first. You can also spray the carrier with Feliway spray before bringing it into the room - this may help your cat to feel more at ease with it.
Continue to feed treats on the blanket or towel every day and very gradually move it closer and closer to the carrier, before your cat enters the room. If your cat looks suspicious of the carrier, you may need to move the bedding further away until they seem relaxed again. You can then try moving it closer to the carrier the next day.
Never try to move the bedding with your cat on it, this may frighten them. Always try to move it before they enter the room, but if you need to while they’re in the room, entice them off it with treats.
You can train your cat to step off the blanket by using a word like “good” just before you give them a treat. This word will eventually become a reward, but this may take several training sessions. When your cat eats their treats comfortably right in front of the carrier, they’re ready for the next step.

Step 2: entering the cat carrier
Place the bedding in the carrier gradually over a number of sessions. If your cat is very nervous of the carrier, leave the lid removed to begin with and keep it out of sight.
When your cat is comfortable lying on their bedding in the carrier, you can put the lid on the floor next to the carrier. And gradually move to put the lid on the carrier. Remember to do this before your cat enters the room and not when they’re in the carrier.
If your cat isn’t happy to enter the carrier with the lid on, go back a few steps and place the bedding outside the carrier again and feed tasty treats on it. Gradually move the bedding back into the carrier with the lid on, even if you have to move a tiny bit of bedding in the carrier each time. Once your cat is lying relaxed on the bedding in the carrier for a few minutes each time you can move onto the next step.

Step 3: closing the cat carrier door
Close the door a tiny bit and then open again, and give your cat a treat. Close the door more and more each time, opening in between times and giving a treat. Repeat this until you can fully close the door with your cat looking relaxed inside the carrier.
If your cat looks worried or moves towards the door, open it again. This way they feel in control at all times. Build up the time with the door closed gradually, so your cat will stay relaxed in the carrier with the door shut for a few minutes.
Then you can try locking the carrier door. Again, build the time up gradually that your cat sits in the locked carrier until you’re sure they’re comfortable in it for the time it takes to go to the vets. Open the door again and give your cat some treats and allow them to come out and stretch their legs.
Once you’ve achieved this, leave the cat carrier out – with the door taken off – in a safe and secure place in the room your cat spends most of their time in. This means your cat can get used to it being there and not just associate it with a trip to the vets.
Occasionally place some treats or your cat’s favourite toys in the carrier, and cover it with a blanket to make it look warm, cosy and inviting. Your cat is now ready for the next step.

Step 4: lifting the cat carrier
Now your cat is happy to be shut in their carrier, it’s time to get them used to be being carried around. Being lifted off the ground and carried around is usually stressful for cats, as they like to feel in control. Go nice and slowly, and don’t feel disheartened if you need to repeat the previous training step.
Start by just touching the handle as if to pick the carrier up. Stop and feed some treats through the bars and talk soothingly to your cat. If they seem relaxed, try lifting the carrier just a few inches off the floor and place it gently down again.
Talk to your cat in a soothing voice and give them some treats through the bars of the carrier - if they still look relaxed you can continue. If your cat looks panicked, miaows or starts to paw at the door, open the carrier and let them out. You can then try again another time, going back a couple of steps.

Step 5: transporting your cat in the carrier
Once your cat is relaxed with you lifting the carrier, you can progress gradually onto walking a few steps. After this, place the carrier down again and feed treats through the bars.
Carry on with this until you can carry your cat towards the front door and finally outside and into the car. Try to carry the carrier with one hand on the handle and one hand underneath if possible, to stop it from swaying or wobbling around.
Once your cat is comfortable being placed in the car, try switching the engine on and off again and giving your cat treats through the bars of the carrier. Remember to talk to them in a soothing voice.
You may decide to take your cat out in the car in their carrier. When you return home scatter treats as you open the carrier door. You could then try taking your cat to the vets, walking into reception and out again, then go home and repeat the treat scattering process.
You can even book an appointment to just take your cat to the vets. Place them on the table and give them some treats without the vet touching your cat. Repeat the process until your cat is comfortable at the vets, before actually taking them for a real appointment.
Once at the vets, you can train your cat to exit the carrier onto the examination table by placing it on the table, opening the door, and scattering more treats.          "
How to introduce your cat to a new cat," Here are some points to consider before you take on a new cat, and a guide on how to integrate them into your family.
What type of cat should I rehome?
Before choosing a new cat, your main concern should be how your existing cat will feel about a new arrival. Some important points to consider are:

 	What is your current cat’s temperament like? Decide what sort of personality you feel your cat would accept – and whether they would benefit from a new companion
 	If you have a kitten, it’s often easier to introduce another kitten because they have not yet reached social maturity and will often bond through play
 	Elderly cats can find it hard to cope with young, energetic cats and kittens.

Cats can live happily on their own or in groups?
While cats can live in harmony with their feline friends, many are perfectly content living on their own. Cats in their natural environment are solitary hunters but we know that feral cat colonies, usually made up of related females, can live happily in close social contact.
If you do decide to bring a new cat into your home, the most important thing to remember is that a slow introduction will pose less threat to your existing cat. Rushing the process can cause issues that are hard to rectify.

How to start introducing cats
Start by confining your new cat in a quiet separate room, such as a spare bedroom, along with a litter tray, food and water bowls, a bed, a scratching post and toys. Allow your other cat to access the rest of the house as usual.
You should leave your new cat alone initially to allow them to explore and establish themselves in the new environment, so they feel comfortable and in control. Then, spend equal time with your new cat and your existing cat until both feel content. They will already be aware of each other’s presence through scent.

The importance of swapping scents
Once both cats are settled, you can start to swap scents. This is probably the most important part of any cat introduction, as cats rely heavily on taking information in through scent.

Scent swapping involves swapping items of bedding and toys and placing them in the other cat’s space in the home. Allow your existing cat to rub their cheeks on a blanket or rag and place it in the spare room for the new cat to sniff and vice versa.  Never rub one cat with an item of bedding and then rub it directly on the other cat, as this may overwhelm them.

Once both cats seem to be quite relaxed with the others scent, you can start giving them tasty treats and letting them play with toys either side of the spare room door. This will help them both start to build a good association with what lies on the other side of the door. Preparation before the cats meet
Before they meet, you should ensure your existing cat and new cat have their own resources spread around the home. Cats are territorial animals, their territory includes their food source, sleeping place, water bowl and litter tray.

Provide them with separate feeding stations, as far away from each other as possible, and a variety of water bowls. Make sure your cats have at least one litter tray each, in a different room to each other and in a secluded place (but with easy access). Give each cat their own toys and scratching posts.

Ensure there are plenty of hiding places and high-up resting places for the cats around the house. This will allow the cats to live in close proximity, but without having direct contact unless they decide to. You can keep the spare room as your new cat’s base for a while, with food, water and litter tray in there, so they alway have a familiar place to come back to.
Your cats’ first meeting
When both cats seem settled on either side of the door that’s separating them, start by opening the spare room door slightly. Don’t force introductions, just let your cats meet in their own time. When they’re in the same room, try to distract each of them with toys and food at opposite ends of the room. Your two cats will assess each other through scent, body language, posture and sound.

You should expect some hissing and growling at this stage. If the introduction results in fighting, place a pillow or sheet between the two cats and put your new cat back in the spare room when it’s safe to pick them up. Never break up a fight by picking one cat up, as you’re likely to get injured in the process.
Try again when both cats have completely calmed down
It may take a little while for both cats to get used to each other, but they will usually settle if they have enough space and resources. If they seem to be getting on well together, or at least tolerating each other, you can let them both have free access to the house. Unless you’re concerned they may fight if left alone together, there’s no need to separate them when you are out, or overnight.
Will they live happily ever after?
It’s not uncommon to see a cat of any age re-homed with existing cats and settling well, as long as they were introduced correctly. In time, most cats will come to accept the new arrival. Some may merely learn to tolerate each other, but some may even become the best of friends.

How to handle your cat,"Let your new cat settle in the home before attempting too much handling, it can be very overwhelming for them if everything happens at once. Here are a few hints and tips to help you handle your cat:
Use treats
Food rewards are a great way to interact with your cat and encourage positive handling.
Give your cat time and space
Cats are naturally ‘flight’ animals so if they are scared or intimidated they are going to make all efforts to get away. This may mean that they inadvertently scratch or bite in order to make their escape quickly. Let your cat be handled in their own time and the chances of this happening are greatly reduced.
Keep an eye on children
Some children will be very enthusiastic about their new arrival and may be inclined to grab when they want to interact with your cat. All initial handlings should be supervised by an adult.
Picking your cat up
When picking your cat up, put one hand under their breast bone and the other hand supporting their bottom. Lift them gently, but confidently, pulling him into your body for his support. Some cats don’t want to be picked up
Nervous cats find being picked up quite stressful. It’s more important to let these cats demonstrate affection on their terms rather than imposing it on them. They may prefer to be stroked and groomed – this is also an effective way of bonding with your new cat.

Cats generally feel more secure when they have all four feet on the ground, especially if they are particularly nervous or independent.
How to get your cat into a carrier
Getting your cat in the carrier can be quite a difficult task and one that most owners dread. It is often best to purchase a large front loading carrier, hold the cat securely and place the cat in backwards. For particularly difficult cats it may be worth investing in a top loading carry basket, that way the cat can be picked up and placed in the carrier.

Try leaving the carrier open in the home for a few days before transporting your cat. Entice your cat into the carrier using tasty treats so they get a positive association with it.
Handling your cat at the vets
When you arrive at the vets, keep the carrier off the floor and cover it with a large towel to make your cat feel calmer. Handle your cat calmly and patiently during the appointment, treats are also a helpful way of reducing their anxiety on the consultation table.

Most vets and nurses are used to handling distressed cats. If you’re in any doubt, ask your vet for advice when you arrive for your appointment.         "

How to choose the right pet sitter,"It has to be an individual decision and there isn't a 'one way fits all' for this subject. The length you are away for, what species you have, and what their specific needs are all play into the decisions.
House sitting and daily visits
For very brief periods, many cats and small animals would be ok staying at home. A trusted, conscientious person who knows and likes them is ideal. You will require someone who can pop in at least twice-daily to ensure they are ok, give any company your pet might need, and the ability to provide essential food, water, as well as the other resources they require to be happy and content during your short absence.

If you have a dog, are going to be away longer, or maybe you have a pet that needs monitoring and extra support, then a house sitter is an option. For many pets, staying in their familiar location is much better than being looked after away from home. Cats are attached to their territory/familiar environment and find being taken to new environments like a cattery stressful. Small pets are more prone to stress when their enclosure and/or location changes, therefore in most cases a house sitter is the best pet-friendly option. There is no regulation of this activity, so you need to do your research and where possible choose someone you already know and trust.
Pet boarding
Traditional boarding kennels and catteries are an option for some pets. As with home boarding and pet sitters, its worth trying a short stay so your pet can get used to the environment. The staff will also be able to give you feedback on how they behaved, if they ate, and other factors, during their stay.

There are specialist boarding facilities for all small pet species. Look for places that have appropriate vaccination, care, and cleaning protocols.  Ensure the housing including any enclosures are suitable sized and are appropriate for the time of year with regards to heatwaves and snow. To avoid any stress or fighting, the housing must keep them separate from other pets. Always pop along and visit before you book. You may not get to see the animals being boarded, but you should ask to see any vacant housing.

If you have a dog who dog is sociable and used to visiting different locations, a pet sitter caring for your pet in their home is an option.  Always consider if your dog likes the person, is going to be ok with their family, will get on with any other pets, and the pet sitter’s daily routines are suitable for them. It’s good to arrange a trial sleepover in advance of their essential stay. Pet sitting is also known as 'home boarding'. Many home boarders are properly licenced regulated professionals. In some ways, it’s similar to boarding kennels, except your dog stays in a more domestic environment, and the numbers of pets each business can accommodate is generally much lower.

Though professional boarding establishments are regulated and the premises are inspected, it is still important to do your homework and ensure that you are comfortable with the individual caring for your precious pet.
Be prepared
Whomever you entrust the care of your pets to, it’s important to give them instructions and information to help them give your pets the care you want them to receive. We recommend providing the following:

 	Veterinary contact info. Also, be sure to tell your vet who is caring for your pet in your absence.
 	If your pet is a dog, ensure the contact info of the person caring for them is added to their tag.
 	Feeding instructions - include what, when, and how your pet should be fed.
 	Include a description of their normal daily routines.
 	Housing needs for small pets and cats.
 	For cats, include litter tray instructions, and where best to place it.
 	Medication, including doses and times if required.
 	How to help them if they appear worried or frightened.
 	Likes and dislikes.
 	Exercise needs.

How to improve your dog's recall," Giving your dog freedom to express their natural behaviour is part of being a responsible dog owner, but the law states your dog must be under control in a public place: this includes recall (coming when called).

Getting started with recall training
Use a longline until your dog has a reliable recall. Attaching a longline to your dog’s body harness means you’re still in control but your dog has enough freedom to enjoy a run.  Always wear gloves to prevent friction burns, and keep an eye on the line so it doesn’t get tangled around anyone’s legs.

 	Start your recall training at home where there are no distractions
 	Use small high value tasty treats like cut up hot dog sausages, chicken, or cheese
 	With your dog in the same room as you, say their name and the word ‘come’. As they come towards you give them verbal praise and a treat
 	If your dog won’t leave you because they know you have treats, throw a treat away from you for them to get and then as they’re eating it call them to you again
 	Once you’re getting 100% success start practising in other rooms in the house
 	Once you’ve cracked the house, move the training into your garden where there are more external distractions.

Move on to a walk
The next step is training your dog’s recall when out on a walk, use a harness and long line for this. Always try to set your dog up for success; during the first few sessions only call them to you when there are no joggers, strangers, other dogs or squirrels about. Wait for your dog to be sniffing something, move a few feet away and then call him to you.
A common mistake is to ask your dog to sit when they get to you. You dog will think the reward is for sitting; so in their mind, they’re not rewarded for the harder task of coming to you and ignoring all the exciting distractions.
The key is to reward your dog for coming towards you. Verbally reward them as soon as they acknowledge your call and start moving towards you, let them know they’re doing the right thing as they’re doing it and when they get to you, give them the treat straight away. If you want them to sit, ask for it after you’ve rewarded their recall.

Use toys if your dog doesn’t respond to treats
For most dogs the training works perfectly, but for some running off to play with other dogs or chasing squirrels is more exciting than a tasty treat. This doesn’t mean that you won’t ever be able to let your dog off the lead.
Professional dog trainers often use of toys when training a recall. Some dogs are happy to mooch about when off lead, others want to tear around and be entertained. If you don’t provide entertainment your dog will go and look for it, often resulting in them getting themselves into trouble.
Training your dog with toys is the same process as using treats. Your recall toy should be one your dog loves. During the house and garden stages of your training keep the toy out of sight at all other times. Your dog will learn that they only get to play with this particular toy when they respond to your recall command. Then recall with more distractions
Once you’re having regular success with your dog’s recall, practice when there are more distractions about. Still use the harness and longline, so you don’t lose control of your dog if they see something exciting.
Play with them with a regular toy and then randomly throw in your recall command and immediately produce a treat or their special toy to play with. Remember, the more fun and entertainment you provide, the less likely your dog will ignore you.

Always reward, never punish
Never punish your dog for ignoring you, or for taking their time to come when called.  It’s common sense for dogs not to go to someone who’s going to be cross with them, and will put your relationship and training back a long way.        "
How to calm an overstimulated dog,"Considering your dog's behaviour
If you are struggling with their behaviour, consider what an average day consists of for your dog.
How much repetitive ball chasing is your dog doing? How much rough-housing and playing with other dogs is he doing? How busy and noisy is your household?  Does he practice barking and ‘seeing off’ postal workers and passers-by? Essentially, how much of the average day does your dog spend being active, alert and over-excited?
When we are stressed, stress hormones are released into our brains. During this time we can’t concentrate properly, our tolerance levels drop, and our sleep is affected, as is our behaviour. We commonly associate stress with negative things that occur in our lives. However, over-excitement, high levels of stimulation and endurance exercise can have the same physiological effects, owing to the stress hormones being released into our brains. This is exactly the same for dogs.
Did you know that the average adult dog should enjoy resting/sleeping for approximately 16 hours over a 24-hour period?  If they are not getting close to this amount of sleep due to an over-stimulating lifestyle, then you may start to see some behavioural issues.
The answer isn’t to force downtime on your dog, but to consider how you can introduce some calming activities into their life so that they are less stimulated. This will help to calm their brain activity, resulting in them being more likely to take themselves off somewhere for a good nap.
&nbsp;
Lowering your dog's excitement levels
If you feel your dog could benefit from lowering their excitement levels, there are a number of things you can do.

Reduce overstimulating activities for your dog
Where possible, reduce activities that cause your dog to be overstimulated. For example, if they bark at passers-by, try shutting the curtains or restricting access to the windows. If the children playing in the garden over-excites your pooch, give them a stuffed kong and limit their garden access to times the garden is calm.
If you feel your dog’s brain is overstimulated, and they are displaying excitable behaviours that frustrate you, consider their mental health and improve it in the following ways:


 	Enrichment feeding: Make meal times last longer and more interesting by utilising enrichment feeding. It slows the process of eating down and requires concentration, which can be tiring for your dog. More information on enrichment feeding
 	Scent games: Hiding things for your dog to find provides wonderful focused mental stimulation, and is always tiring.
 	Sniffing walks: Allowing your dog to stop and sniff when on walks provides them with an opportunity to know about other dogs in the area without getting them over-excited.
 	Training: Force-free training again tires the brain, but it also helps improve your dog’s overall mood. Read our training articles

How to spot if your rabbit has blocked tear ducts,"Dacryocystitis is usually caused by poor eyelid function, blockage of their tear duct, eye infection or inflammation. Most of the time these issues are caused by dental problems - your rabbit has a single tear duct very near to their teeth.

&nbsp;
What are the signs of blocked tear ducts in rabbits?

 	Weepy eyes
 	Lethargy
 	Depression
 	Hunched posture
 	Constant hiding or unwillingness to move
 	Inability to keep food in their mouth, constantly dropping food
 	Loss of hair, crusts, and matted fur around the face
 	Red eyes, sometimes with thick discharge
 	Bulging eyeballs and lumps in the face (common in those with tooth root abscesses)

&nbsp;
How are blocked tear ducts in rabbits diagnosed?
Your vet may have to take X-rays of your rabbit’s teeth to rule out underlying dental problems. If the results show a risk of dental disease, your rabbit may need repeat tooth or jaw x-rays.

If your rabbit needs tests on its eye discharge, if appropriate, you should discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment. How do I treat blocked tear ducts in rabbits?
It's fairly common for rabbits to have chronic blocked tear ducts, especially as they grow older.  Affected rabbits have weepy eyes with a milky coloured discharge in one or both eyes. In some cases their ducts may become permanently blocked, leading to constantly weeping eyes.

Your vet can flush and unblock your rabbit’s tear ducts. You should avoid your rabbit getting fly strike while they’re suffering from blocked tear ducts. Contact your vet immediately if this happens.

&nbsp;
If you're thinking of adopting a rabbit with blocked tear ducts
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new rabbit and ask for more details on how the condition has been treated. You'll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any rabbit who's had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it's worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
How to spot if your cat has calicivirus (FCV),"The virus attacks the respiratory tract, mouth - with ulceration of the tongue, the intestines and the musculoskeletal system. Calicivirus is highly contagious to other unvaccinated cats.
Cats typically catch FCV after coming into contact with other infected cats. Calicivirus is resistant to some disinfectants, so cats can come into contact with the virus in almost any environment. Cats without vaccinations are at higher risk, as are those with a lower immune system due to pre-existing infections or diseases.

What are the symptoms of feline calicivirus (FCV)?
If your cat has calicivirus, the following symptoms will typically present themselves suddenly:


 	Loss of appetite
 	Eye discharge
 	Nasal discharge
 	Development of ulcers on tongue, hard palate, tip of nose, lips or around claws
 	Pneumonia
 	Difficult breathing after development of pneumonia
 	Arthritis (inflammation of joints)
 	Lameness
 	Painful walk
 	Fever
 	Bleeding from various sites
 How is calicivirus treated?
Your cat will be hospitalised for intensive care treatment – this may include broad spectrum antibiotics and possibly intravenous fluids.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.

How do I stop my cat getting FCV?
An FCV vaccination is the best preventative treatment for your cat. It may also reduce the symptoms should your cat become infected with calicivirus.

What to do if your pet has a flea allergy,"How to spot if your pet has a flea allergy

 	Frequent and severe itching and scratching
 	Hair loss
 	Scabs on the skin
 	Affects the hind end more than the front of the body
 	Fleas or flea dirt may or may not be visible.

How are pet flea allergies diagnosed?
If your pet has any of the symptoms above, use a flea comb to inspect their hair for fleas or flea dirt. If you can’t find any, your vet may recommend a skin test for mites or bacterial skin diseases. Often the best way to diagnose a flea allergy is to simply treat for fleas.
How do I treat my pet’s flea allergy?
Flea control and prevention is essential for dogs and cats with flea bite hypersensitivity. There are numerous options on the market that kill adult fleas for a period of time, but all should be repeated (as indicated) for continuous flea control.

Spot-on treatments are applied to a small area, usually at the top of the back of the neck where the pet is unable to lick it off. Oral products are also available - these may be more useful and practical for you and your pet. Flea shampoos can also be beneficial for young animals or for an acute flea infestation, but continuous management with a long-term product is essential.

Cats and dogs who are allergic to fleas may require steroids or antihistamines to combat their sensitivity to the bites. If open sores get infected, they may need antibiotics. Follow-up exams are often necessary to determine how treatments are progressing.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start any treatment.
How do I avoid pet flea allergies reoccurring?
If your pet has a flea allergy, the most effective thing you can do is give them regular doses of flea treatment. It only takes one or two bites for a flea-allergic pet to start itching, so make sure you’re consistent with their flea control products.

Other factors, such as how frequently your bathe your pet and whether you’re using spot-on treatments or creams will determine how long you should wait between doses. Your vet will discuss suitable effective flea products with you – prescription products are more effective than over the counter treatments.
If you’re thinking of adopting a pet with a flea allergy
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new pet and ask for more details on how the fleas have been treated.

How to enclose a garden for my cat,"Cat brackets and fences
If you are looking to build your own, we recommend purchasing meshing that is attached to, and propped up by, strong cat fence brackets around the top of your fence, such as these ones, for example.
To hold each bracket up on a typical fence, 6mm wall plugs can be used, with 4.5x15mm screws.
To attach the cat mesh fencing to the brackets, use standard cable ties, which can be found in most DIY stores, or some fences can benefit from using a staple gun. Do not use sparingly, to ensure that the mesh stays up in more severe weathers.
Depending on the size and shape of the garden and neighbouring gardens, careful planting of trees and thick bushes/hedges around the perimeter of the garden can prevent a cat from escaping, but all trees will need to be fenced in with bracketing and mesh, to ensure that your cat does not climb up and out of the garden.

Building a 'catio'
A catio is a large screened-off section which typically will sit on your patio. Catios can be set up to allow your cat easy access via a window or through a cat flap.
A great example can be found here. It is worth noting that a catio will only allow a cat limited access to the garden, so creating an enclosed garden is preferred if possible to ensure that your cat has more freedom. Fitting a catio or enclosed garden
If you are not comfortable with putting up a catio or fencing for your cat’s enclosed garden yourself, then there are plenty of companies who will be able to provide this service for you. A few that we recommend are:

Benefits of your cat having outdoor access

 	Feeling more relaxed while in the house
 	Less likely to have frustration related behaviour issues
 	Able to mark their territory
 	Ability to escape to a safe area from situations in the home such as other cats or any noise they dislike.

Whatever option you choose to provide for your cat, try to make sure that your garden or enclosure is suitably enriched for your cat to enjoy the outside space to its full effect.

By making a few simple changes to your garden, you can create a wonderful environment for your cat to enjoy all year round. Below are some ideas on how to enrich your outdoor space:
 Hiding places

 	Look at the area directly outside your door, where the cat flap is or where you let your cat out. Is there enough space for your cat to hide behind? Cats like to feel that they have a bolt hole nearby, so if they see or hear something that worries them, they can run for cover.
 	Placing plant pots or small shrubs in this area will enable your cat to feel safer directly outside the home. Make sure that any plants and shrubs you choose are not toxic to cats. Download our dangerous plants list (PDF)
 	Providing shelter and places to hide in the rest of the garden will protect your cat from the rain or the mid-day sun. Shelter can be in the form of large shrubs, trees, garden furniture and sun parasols.

Cats love to climb and they generally feel safer surveying their territory from up high, so provide your cat with some logs, posts and a couple of easy to reach perching platforms. They will also use these to scratch and mark their territory.

Shed roofs are usually a very popular space for cats to keep a look out. Try to work out a safe way up and down from here, as this would be a big benefit for your cat.
Outdoor toileting
If you would like to encourage your cat to toilet outside, provide a small section of the garden with some loose non-toxic sand or soil for them to use as a designated latrine area.

Ideally, make sure it is in a more sheltered area of the garden, to make it appealing for your cat to use in all weathers. This area will need to be cleaned out daily to keep your cat going back there.
Water features
Many cats prefer to drink outside from large water containers. Providing safe water features, fountains or rain collection dishes will give your cat a variety of options. Some cats even enjoy playing in water!
Cat friendly plants
Natural grasses and cat grass helps aid in your cat’s digestion and makes the environment feel more natural, as will non-toxic, cat friendly plants and herbs, such as bamboo, catnip, lavender and valerian.
Toys
Distributing plenty of toys outside (and inside) will provide plenty of entertainment for your cat, helping them to feel happy and reduce feelings of frustration.
Scratching facilities
Fences and trees make great scratching places for cats. Not only will they leave their scent and mark their territory on these areas, they also use them to sharpen their claws and condition their bodies. Providing extra logs or outdoor climbing facilities will add more adventure and opportunities for your cat.

Cat behavioural traits," Below are a range of behaviours that you should expect to see from your pet cat.
Hunting
Cats are a predatory species, which means they hunt to survive. Giving them food meets their nutritional needs, but not their behavioural needs. Many pet cats still love to hunt and will often bring home small mammals, birds and insects either as gifts for you or to play with themselves. Don’t punish this type of behaviour as it’s completely natural.
Marking
Cats will naturally mark their territory – this is their home and surrounding environment. Cats normally mark by scratching and using their face. When your cat rubs the sides of their face on objects in the home and on people they leave behind a pheromone from scent glands. This not only marks their territory so other cats are aware of their presence, but is also a reassuring and comforting scent for them.

If you see other extreme forms of marking such as spraying, urinating or defecating in the house then please ask us for advice.
Scratching
Make sure you provide scratching areas around the house – otherwise your carpet and furniture will suffer! Scratching is a completely normal behaviour for your cat and usually takes place where the cat enters or exits the house. Provide a wide range of scratching materials in this area, making use of the horizontal and vertical space.
Purring and kneading
Each cat has an individual purr, some do it regularly and others hardly ever purr. Purring is usually only expressed when the cat is content and settled. Surprisingly, cats can also purr when they’re in extreme pain or discomfort. It is thought that this type of purring calms the cat to help it cope with the situation.

Your cat will often knead furniture or your lap. This is where they contract and expand their paws repeatedly. This is a completely normal behaviour but often uncomfortable as their claws can dig in. Your cat is scenting you and also mimicking a behaviour they learned as a kitten, when suckling on the mother they knead to stimulate milk flow. Kittens
Kittens have short, sharp bursts of energy throughout the day. They need lots of interaction to help them become well socialised – remember they will not be going outside at this point so it’s important to do lots of playing in the house.

Kittens are extremely lively and can really get under your feet. They have bursts of energy which often see them climbing up curtains or getting into mischief. You will need to have lots of energy just to keep your kitten entertained! Kittens enjoy playing, so make sure there are plenty of toys available to amuse them.
Adult cats
Adult cats will have moderate levels of energy. They will spend a significant proportion of the day sleeping but will also need a few hours interaction during the day. Cats are crepuscular animals. Meaning they are most likely to be active at dusk and dawn.
Older cats
Make time to engage your older cat in play. Older cats can sometimes choose to sleep a lot so by engaging in play, you are not only creating some fun for your cat but also some light exercise at the same time.
All cats are individual
It’s important to remember that each cat you own will act completely differently to another. Sometimes what we think of as behavioural issues or perfectly natural. If your cat’s behaviour has changed, it may be due to an underlying medical disorder: read our cat health advice articles first, then check with your vet if your concerned.        "
Keeping indoor cats entertained,"Think about how you feed your indoor cat
Most cats will have always been fed from a bowl. Try stimulating your cat by hiding treats around the home for them to find, this will make feeding time more fun! You can also buy or make special feeders like puzzle feeders or treat balls. Introduce these gradually and remember some cats will always prefer to eat their food from a bowl. Grow your own cat grass to aid your cat’s digestion.
Automatic pet feeders are very useful if you want your cat to eat specific amounts at set times. The voice activated ones work well, as you can record your voice calling your cat and set it for 4am. This way your cat eats at the time they would normally wake you up to be fed or play.

Lots of ways for indoor cats to drink water
Keep food and water bowls separately. Remember that cats are lactose intolerant, so milk is not a good replacement for water. Cats will often only drink from something that their whiskers don’t have to touch (this is why they often drink from a full glass of water).
Encourage your cat to drink by offering larger water bowls, water fountains, or a running tap, as these stimulate your cat’s desire to drink and are great way to keep them occupied.

Toileting areas for indoor cats
Indoor cats need several options for toileting. Allow for one litter tray per cat plus one, placed away from each other in areas where they won’t get disturbed.
Litter trays come in a variety of sizes, and can be open or covered, if you want to provide your cats with more privacy. Buying a litter tray that suits your cat’s size means they are more likely to use it and won’t make the mistake of toileting over the edge of an open tray.

Relaxation and sleep for indoor cats
Quite often cats like places out of the way or high up. On top of the fridge or underneath a chair are often favourites, so they’re well protected and undisturbed whilst they sleep. Provide your cat with a nice comfy bed in the areas of their choice. Also consider cat beds that incorporate perch and hide opportunities, like radiator or covered beds.
There are also complementary products available which can relax cats, relieve their anxiety and help them get along together. Feline diffusers can help your cat feel more relaxed in the home, some are specifically designed to help improve relationships between cats. Cat anxiety remedies, available in tablets or as supplements, can take the edge off any anxious feelings your cat may have.

Plenty of scratching areas for indoor cats
Give your cats at least one scratching area like a sturdy scratching post, scratch pad (old carpet tile) or disposable scratcher. This is a form of scent marking and something you should encourage.
Let your cat build up a scent profile around their home, to feel safe and secure. Where possible vertical scratching posts must be high enough for the cat to stretch up and scratch and placed in entrances and exits of rooms. Your cat may also like a carpet tile to scratch in these areas as well. The importance of hiding and perching for indoor cats
Your cat should have the option to hide and perch.  Give them an upturned sturdy cardboard box (big enough for your cat to lie in, turn around in and sit on top of), a chair with a large towel draped over it, or similar items in your home. If possible, there should be hiding and perching options in all rooms and floors of your cat’s home.

Jumping and climbing for indoor cats
All cats should have the opportunity to climb and jump up high. You could use tree branches for ramps, provide platforms and sturdy cardboard boxes, tall scratching posts and even let them explore shelving – minus the ornaments, of course.

Playing, hunting and mental stimulation for indoor cats
Encourage your cat to play with toys and rotate them regularly to prevent over-familiarity and boredom. Use toys that emulate the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat. If your indoor cat likes to play predatory games, then play with them at various times throughout day with a suitable toy. This means your cat can express their natural hunting behaviours. Some examples of predatory toys to mentally stimulate your cat are:


 	String toys
 	Feather toys
 	Ping pong balls
 	Cat nip toys
 	Stalking toys

When playing with your cat, remember to give a food reward to finish off the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat.  Avoid any toys (like laser pens) that do not allow your cat to follow this natural hunting sequence, as this can cause your cat to get frustrated and redirect this frustration on to you. If you do use one of these toys, finish the game by offering a toy for your cat to ‘kill' and a tasty treat afterwards.

If your cat is distressed by outdoor cats
If an indoor cat is showing signs of stress due to other cats directly outside your home, try to prevent your cat from seeing, hearing and smelling them.  Cover floor level windows and glass doors to block your cat’s view of outside from the ground, and then create high perches in front of windows. Your cat will feel happier if they can look down on the other cats outside. Leaving a radio on to cover any sound can also help reduce stress.

Provide an outdoor space for your indoor cat
Providing some space outside will allow your cat to express their natural behaviours in a more natural environment. They may also like this space to sunbathe in sunny weather.
If you have a balcony, you can make it part of your indoor cat’s territory with a cat balcony kit. Cat-safe garden fencing and outdoor runs mean your cat can enjoy the garden without the chance of escape. Window covers give your cat access to fresh air, while keeping them safely inside.         "
How to spot if your cat has feline cystitis,"Cystitis can occur in both female and male cats. It’s a chronic disease that can be difficult to treat and frustrating for you and your cat.
The causes aren’t fully understood, but stress is thought to play a large part in interstitial cystitis.

What are the signs of feline cystitis?

 	Frequent attempts to urinate
 	Straining to urinate
 	Urinating in inappropriate places in the house
 	Crying out during attempts to urinate
 	Blood-tinged urine
 	If you have a male cat who can’t urinate, then he may have a blocked bladder – seek veterinary attention as soon as possible

What to do if you suspect your cat has cystitis
Visit your vet - they’ll perform blood tests and urinalysis to diagnose the condition. They may also carry out an abdominal X-ray and an ultrasound exam to rule out stones and other abnormal structures in the bladder. How is feline cystitis treated and what are the costs?
Your cat is likely to be prescribed pain medication to relieve the discomfort caused by the inflammation within the bladder and urinary tract. This will make them more comfortable while urinating.
You may also need to change your cat’s diet - your vet will advise you if they recommend a special diet. Increasing your cat’s water consumption is an important part of treatment and feeding them wet food, when possible, will help increase the moisture content in their diet.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment.

How do I avoid feline cystitis reoccurring in my cat?
Making changes to your cat's environment can help reduce their stress levels. Dietary modifications, pain medication and other medicines can also help with this.
Providing all of your cat’s basic needs such as good quality food, clean water, a place to hide and interactive toys all help to minimise the stress levels that can cause cystitis. Pheromones such as Feliway can also help reduce your cat’s stress.

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with feline cystitis
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new cat and ask for more details on how the cystitis was treated.  You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any cat who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
Does my cat have azotemia?,"What are the signs of azotemia in cats?

 	Weakness
 	Dull coat
 	Depression
 	Dehydration
 	Weight loss
 	Bad breath
 	Loss of appetite
 	Muscle wastage

How is azotemia in cats treated?
Your vet will take a blood sample to determine the levels of urea and creatinine in your pet’s blood. If they’re high, this is a good indication of kidney (renal) failure.
Your pet would then be prescribed with a veterinary renal diet. Treatment with the prescription drug Fortekor may also be beneficial. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment. How do I avoid azotemia reoccurring in my cat?
Make sure your pet has access to fresh drinking water at all times. Renal failure is a progressive condition, but prescription diets and medication can slow the condition’s progress and may improve your pet’s quality of life.
If your pet develops anorexia or anaemia then they may benefit from a monthly anabolic steroid injection. Your vet will advise you on this.
Unfortunately, if your pet has azotemia their condition is likely to deteriorate over time. If you notice an increase in your pet’s drinking or urination, if they go off their food, lose weight, suffer from vomiting or diarrhoea then you should take them to the vet.

How to spot if your cat has cat flu,"Just like us, cats feel under the weather too sometimes and can experience symptoms similar to a human cold, like sneezing, weepy eyes, runny noses and a fever. Upper respiratory infections in cats is usually caused by one of two types of virus, feline calicivirus and feline herpes virus - or sometimes by certain types of bacteria. Cat flu is spread much like a human cold in saliva, sneezes and snot on bedding and food bowls in particular.

It’s important to note however, the virus only affects cats and can’t be spread to humans or other animals. Kittens are more at risk than adult cats because their vulnerable immune systems find it harder to fight off nasty infections.
Spotting the symptoms of cat flu
While our cats can be protected from flu, if they’re not vaccinated it can be caught very easily from other cats. There are symptoms to look out for though and this will help you know when to contact a vet.

Symptoms include:

 	Runny nose and eyes
 	Sore throat
 	Aches and pains in the muscles and joints
 	Mouth ulcers
 	Dribbling
 	Sneezing
 	Loss of voice and a cough
 	Fever

What treatment is available?
Unfortunately, there’s no cure for cat flu and once caught, they’re likely to continue to spread it throughout their life and experience lingering symptoms. The good news is, there are lots of ways to make your cat feel more comfortable, reduce their symptoms and help get them back to feeling themselves sooner.

Here are a few ways:

 	Antibiotics – Will be prescribed by your vet if they think your cat has a bacterial infection.
 	Regularly wipe away any discharge from your cat’s nose and eyes to help them feel better and breathe easier.
 	Encourage them to continue eating by tempting them with strong smelling, tasty foods. This will keep their energy levels up.

If your cat’s symptoms don’t go away, further tests may be needed to identify the underlying cause. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before agreeing to any tests.
Prevention
One of the best ways of protecting your cat against cat flu is ensuring your cat is vaccinated as soon as they’re old enough (8-9 weeks)

Your vet can advise you on this. Again, much like with human flu, there are lots of different strains of virus, so the vaccine isn’t effective against them all. Your cat will need two doses first, followed by regular boosters throughout their life.

Some cats have recurrent episodes of the flu, particularly during stressful times such as rehoming or going to a cattery.
Things to consider
If you’re thinking of adopting a cat that you know has had cat flu in the past, be sure to review their medical notes and ask for more details on what they did for the cat and whether they still experience symptoms. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition.

Any cat who’s had treatment including antibiotics, prescribed medication or hospitalisation is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.          "
Conjunctivitis in cats - what you need to know,"How to spot if your cat has conjunctivitis
There are several common symptoms of conjunctivitis including:


 	Persistent squinting
 	Regular and excessive blinking
 	Redness of the eye tissue
 	Eye discharge
 	Fluid build-up in the eye
 	Upper respiratory infection

What causes conjunctivitis in cats?
There are several viruses that cause conjunctivitis, one of the most common is the herpes virus. Cats who are regularly exposed to other cats with viral infections are more prone to develop the disease.
Bacteria can also cause conjunctivitis, as can allergies or even a stone or dust particle lodging in the eye. Purebred cats are more likely to develop the disease than other cats. If your cat has dry eye then they may be more likely to get conjunctivitis.

How is conjunctivitis in cats treated?
If there is a suspected allergy causing the infection, the issue should clear up when the cause is removed from your cat's environment. If the infection is due to a virus or bacteria, there are some commonly prescribed medications to manage the inflammation – including oral and external antibiotics.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment.

How do I avoid conjunctivitis reoccurring in my cat?
Limiting your cat’s exposure to possibly-affected animals can prevent recurrence of conjunctivitis

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with conjunctivitis
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new cat and ask for more details on how the conjunctivitis has been treated.

Food that is poisonous to cats
Many cats are lactose intolerant, so avoid giving them cow's milk. Make sure fresh water is available at all times.

Human food including cheese, chocolate or eggs, should be avoided as treats, unless it is steamed white fish or chicken. Keep raw dough out of reach of your cat too.          "
How to spot if your cat has bordetellosis,"What are the signs of bordetellosis in cats?
Some carrier cats may not show any symptoms but the most common signs are:

 	Fever
 	Lethargy
 	Sneezing
 	Nasal discharge
 	Loss of appetite
 	Difficulty breathing
 	Crackling lung sounds, moist cough, or (less frequently) wheezing
 	Swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, under the jaw

Cats that have bordetellosis can spread the bacteria for up to five months, so it is important to keep them isolated from other cats.
 How is cat bordetellosis treated?
If you suspect your cat has bordetellosis, your vet will perform a complete physical examination as well as a full blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis and electrolyte panel. They may also carry out an X-ray to view any abnormalities of the lungs – especially if pneumonia has developed.

Your cat should rest in a quiet place, and your vet will prescribe antimicrobial medication and fluid therapy. Your cat should recover in a few weeks, though repeat x-rays may be needed.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.
How do I stop my cat getting bordetellosis?
If your cat hasn’t already contracted the condition, you can have them vaccinated against bordetellosis.

How to leave your dog on their own,"Luckily there is now a range of simple to use pet cameras that could help you understand how your dog is feeling when home alone. Some dogs bark and howl, some display destructive behaviours when left, and others go to the toilet.
Barking can either be your dog trying to get your attention and howling is generally a sign your dog is not coping at home alone. Or maybe he is barking because he is seeing something he'd like to chase out of a window or door, or is a defence mechanism to dogs or passers-by he can hear or see. Going to the toilet is a relieving act, so if your dog messes when left, they will feel a form of stress relief. Chewing is a natural act for a dog and can help them feeling relaxed if they are stressed, or entertain them if they are bored.

Fix the problem not the symptom
All too often people concentrate on fixing the symptoms of a behavioural problem and not on the underlying reason. The key to helping your dog cope at home alone is to ensure they’re happy about the idea in the first place.

Exercise and training
Exercise your dog before you leave the house. Don’t wear them out, as this means they’ll drink lots of water when they get home and will need the toilet sooner rather than later. They just need to stretch their legs and go to the toilet.
It’s also worth doing a few minutes of general training with your dog before you go out. This will help exercise their brain and give them something to process later.

Prepare a 'home alone box'
Creating a home alone box is a great way to train your dog to enjoy time on their own. Your box should include the following:


 	a couple of stuffed Kongs
 	a few dog biscuits wrapped individually in sheets of newspaper
 	empty toilet rolls with chew sticks inside or poked through the sides
 	an empty plastic bottle (minus the ring and cap) containing a few bits of kibble
 	their favourite toys or anything else they really love to play with.

Let your dog watch you prepare the box –  so that their emotional state is one of happiness and expectation. Next draw your curtains so that they can’t be distracted by the outside world and put on the tv or radio to help mask the sounds of people or cars passing by. Build up your time away
Just as you’re about to leave, place the box on the floor and encourage your dog to have a rummage. Then calmly and confidently leave the house. The first time you do this only leave for a short amount of time, less than twenty minutes. When you enter the house again immediately pick up the box and bits they have taken out and put them on the side. It won’t take long for your dog to realise that this box of delights only comes out when they’re going to be left on their own.
As your dog’s confidence grows you can reduce the amount of stuff you put in the box and slowly increase the time you’re away. Dogs are creatures of habit so it’s easier to teach them to cope home alone in the early stages if they can predict a routine. Once you’ve cracked it you can be a little more spontaneous.

Think about evenings
While many dogs can learn to cope home alone for a working day, they are very sociable animals and it can be upsetting if they’re also left them alone in the evenings. If you work full time and then have a busy evening ahead, think of ways you can minimise the length of overall time your dog will be left.
For example, do you have a friend or family member who is willing to dog-sit for you during the day or evening? Will your plans allow for you to take your dog with you? If you have a very hectic social life that keeps you out of the house on a regular basis and your dog is suffering from anxiety, you may need to consider if this is the right time in your life to own a dog.         "
Recall training - for dogs that chase," Most owners achieve this without too many issues.  However, some dogs get a real kick out of chasing things that they shouldn’t, such as joggers and cyclists. When they are distracted/focused by this behaviour, they are unlikely to respond to an owners call.
In order to address this, a more targeted approach for this particular issue is required.
We call it the 'chase recall'. The aim of this exercise is that when the dog hears a particular word or sound, they learn to disengage from what they are chasing to respond to the owner and chase something more appropriate instead.

What you will need

 	A harness
 	A long-line lead
 	Gloves (Whenever you handle a long-line lead, you should always wear a pair of gloves. If you get caught out and the line runs through your bare hands, you could receive some nasty friction burns).
 	Two toys (One that your dog absolutely loves and enjoys chasing, and one that is still interesting but of less value to your dog. In some cases, a squeaky toy can be beneficial too).

The harness and long line are needed for safety reasons. The low-value toy will be used as a decoy, and the high value toy will be used as a reward. Teaching a 'chase recall'
The first step in teaching a ‘chase recall’ is to condition the word ‘come’ (or any word or sound of your choice) to mean ‘chase this instead’.
This is done by starting in the house or garden. Wait for your dog to be distracted by something and shout your chosen recall word. As soon as your dog looks at you, shout ‘yes’ and throw the high value toy for him to chase. Once you have achieved a positive and enthusiastic response, you are ready to move onto the next step.
The next step requires you to take your dog to an area where you are unlikely to encounter your dogs chase triggers. This is where the less exciting toy come into play. Try throwing this toy and as soon as your dog engages in chasing it, shout your recall word and see if he acknowledges your call. If he does, shout yes and immediately throw his favourite toy in the opposite direction. Remember, we want your recall word to mean ‘stop chasing that and come and chase this’. For some dogs you might need a squeaky to help break their focus away from the first toy. If your dog likes a squeaky toy, the sequence would be ‘recall word', a squeak of the toy, and then throwing the high value toy.
Once this has become reliable in an environment without any chase trigger distractions, its time to up the ante and try it in a more challenging setting.
This is where the harness and long line are important. It is socially unacceptable and in some cases dangerous to allow a dog to engage in chase behaviours as they can result in accidents - someone might fall of their bike or even receive a nip on the back of their leg. This cannot be allowed to happen, hence the use of a long line. We also need to prevent the dog from practicing the unwanted behaviour of chasing.
Keep working with the two different toys to ensure the response is still solid in that setting, and then bring in the help of a third party.
Setting up a training exercise where a third party can play the role of your dogs trigger is a very valuable step.
The advantage of using a third party is that they can be instructed to stop all movement if your dog fails to respond to your call. By stopping their movement, the trigger becomes less exciting and your dog is more likely to then respond to your call.
Once you have achieved reliability with regards to your stooge trigger, you can then trial your training in the real world. Be sure to keep the long line attached.
Remember, each time you change a location you may have to go back a step. This is normal in all aspects of dog training.
Finally, just because your dog now comes when he is called, please don’t take his compliance for granted. If there’s one exercise that should be frequently rewarded, it is coming when called. Also, it is a fact of life that NO dog has a 100% reliable recall - they are sentient beings and can have ‘off’ days just like us.
Enjoy your training!

Neutering your dog: what you need to know,"Many people worry that neutering their pet is not natural, but it is worth remembering that keeping a domesticated pet isn’t a natural situation.

Unwanted puppies are a big problem nationally
Each year thousands of puppies will find themselves abandoned, often the result of unplanned or poorly considered breeding. While some puppies may find homes initially, many find themselves unwanted once the novelty wears off or they get a little bigger.

Dog relationships are different
Dogs don't recognise family relationships and brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers will mate with each other. If you have an un-neutered male and female living together, no matter how well they are separated, it will only take a split second for them to mate should they meet.
If you don’t neuter a male dog, he will be able to smell female dogs in heat. This will cause him a lot of anxiety and lead to frustration-related behaviours and illnesses.

Neutering will save you money
There are financial implications to your dog having a litter. Specific health tests are required for many dog breeds and birth complications will require expensive veterinary treatment.

Neutering helps temperament and behaviour
Although neutering will not fix all problem behaviours, it can help with roaming, mounting of humans and other dogs, urine marking in the house and some forms of aggression.
Roaming can be a big problem in male dogs. They can smell a female dog in heat from approximately a mile away - no matter how well trained they are, they’re less likely to listen to you when their hormones kick in. Neutering improves your dog’s health
There are several illnesses more commonly found in un-neutered dogs, many of them fatal. These include womb infections and mammary cancer in females and testicular and prostate cancer in males. Also, pregnancy and giving birth are not without risks for female dogs.

When is the best age to spay a female dog?
Female dogs can be neutered any time after their first season. There’s no evidence that it’s healthier for a pet to have a litter before being spayed. Animals do not experience the same feelings about motherhood as humans do and the first litter for a female is often the most difficult and high risk. Male dogs can be neutered from six months.

Your dog’s recovery time
After neutering, your dog should be back on their food within 24 hours, and their skin should heal within 14 days.

Neutering costs and help available
It can cost anywhere between £100 and £300 to neuter a dog, without accounting for any added complications. Help with neutering costs may be available for certain people on low incomes from Woodgreen, Cats Protection, RSPCA, PDSA, Blue Cross.         "
What should I do if my dog goes missing?,"
 	Report your dog as missing to your local authority dog warden as soon as possible, they’ll have records of found strays in their area. It is a legal requirement to report that you have found a dog.
 	If your dog is microchipped, inform the microchip company, this is usually Petlog. Ensure that you update any information that may have changed, and tell them your dog is missing. Please have your dog’s microchip number to hand before ringing. Reporting your dog as missing can help to reunite you to your dog even in the future.
 	Report your dog as missing to all rescue centres in the local area, and in a wider area depending on how long it has been missing. Keep in regular contact with them. Call our team or email them to check if we have your dog.
 	Register your dog on Dog Lost. This is a free volunteer-based online service which has helped reunite many dogs to their owners.
 	Register your dog on Animal Search UK. It is the UK's largest missing pet organisation.
 	Report your dog lost to all veterinary surgeries in the area and keep in regular contact with them.
 	Put up posters with your contact details and go door-to-door to find out if there have been any sightings of your dog. You could also use local social media pages to share photos and ask if anyone has seen your dog.
 	Keep looking on missing dog websites to make sure there are no reports of your dog.

How to prevent your dog from going missing
If you’re concerned that your dog may go missing in the future, here are some preventative tips.

 	Keep your dog’s microchip details current, if you move house remember to update the records, this is a legal requirement.
 	It is also a legal requirement for your dog to wear identification in public places. The collar or the tag/badge attached to it must have the name and address of the owner on it, and we strongly recommend a contact number to be included too.
 	You should not let your dog off the lead until you have built up a good enough recall and know you will have control of them in public places.
 	You should make sure that your garden is fully secure: dogs can be clever escape artists!
 	Get your dog neutered. Females act different when in season, and more likely to stray. Males can stray when they want to reach females in season.

Conjunctivitis in dogs - what you need to know,"How to spot if your dog has conjunctivitis
There are several common symptoms of conjunctivitis including:

 	Persistent squinting
 	Regular and excessive blinking
 	Redness of the eye tissue
 	Eye discharge
 	Fluid build-up in the eye
 	Upper respiratory infection

What causes conjunctivitis in dogs?
There are several viruses that cause conjunctivitis, one of the most common is the herpes virus. Dogs who are regularly exposed to other dogs with viral infections are more prone to develop the disease.

Bacteria can also cause conjunctivitis, as can allergies or even a stone or dust particle lodging in the eye. If your dog has dry eye then they may be more like to get conjunctivitis. How is conjunctivitis in dogs treated?
If there is a suspected allergy causing the infection, the issue should clear up when the cause is removed from your dog's environment. If the infection is due to a virus or bacteria, there are some commonly prescribed medications to manage the inflammation – including oral and external antibiotics.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment.
How do I avoid the conjunctivitis reoccurring in my dog?
Limiting your dog’s exposure to possibly-affected animals can prevent recurrence of conjunctivitis
If you’re thinking of adopting a dog with conjunctivitis
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new dog and ask for more details on how the conjunctivitis has been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any dog who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
How to spot if your dog has hip dysplasia,"This malformation means the ball portion and its socket don’t properly meet one another – resulting in a joint that rubs and grinds instead of sliding smoothly.
What are the signs of hip dysplasia in dogs?
The symptoms depend on how far the disease has progressed. Signs of hip dysplasia can be:

 	Decreased activity
 	Difficulty getting up
 	Reluctance to run, jump, or climb stairs
 	Intermittent or persistent lameness in back legs, often worse after exercise
 	‘Bunny-hopping’ or swaying gait
 	Back legs unnaturally close together
 	Pain in hip joints

How is hip dysplasia diagnosed in dogs?
If you suspect your dog has hip dysplasia, your vet will perform a complete physical exam and may x-ray them. How is hip dysplasia treated in dogs?
Most cases of hip dysplasia are managed medically. Arthritis will develop in the hip joints over time, resulting in discomfort. Managing your dog’s weight, gentle exercise, hydrotherapy and joint supplements are all useful in treating the symptoms of the disease.

Later in your dog’s life, they may require pain medication. In some cases, surgery can be performed. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.
If you’re thinking of adopting a dog with hip dysplasia

Has my dog got ringworm?,"It’s very contagious and can be easily passed onto other animals and even humans - either from direct contact or simply by being in the same environment as an infected animal.

Ringworm spores are very robust and can remain infectious in the environment for years.
What are the signs of ringworm in dogs?

 	Skin lesions, especially found on the face, ears, limbs and under the nails
 	Hair-loss in the shape of circular patches, revealing scaling, crusting, thickening or reddening of the skin.

The appearance of ringworm may be quite variable and can look similar to other skin diseases. It can affect large areas of the body, often with patchy hair loss. Ringworm in pets is not usually itchy.
How is ringworm in dogs diagnosed?
Diagnosis of ringworm is usually straightforward. Infected hairs can be examined under ultra-violet light or under the microscope for evidence of fungal infection. Your vet may send a fungal sample away for culture testing to be sure.
How is ringworm in dogs treated?
Ringworm can take 3-5 months to clear - during this time your pet will remain contagious and should be isolated from other animals. A combination of antifungal drugs by mouth and medicated shampoos and dips directly on the skin have been proven to provide the quickest treatment.

Treatment is always continued until your pet has two consecutive negative fungal test results. At this point you can release them from isolation and consider them cured from ringworm.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start any treatments.
How do I avoid ringworm reoccurring in my dog?
If your pet has ringworm, restrict them to certain rooms of the house that are easy to clean. Thorough vacuum-cleaning is the best way to minimise environmental contamination and should be done as frequently as possible.

If any people in the house develop skin lesions (small patches of skin thickening and reddening, or patches of hair loss) they should seek early medical attention. Ringworm in humans generally responds very well to treatment.          "
Canine Parvovirus: what you need to know,"The virus comes in two different forms. The more common form is intestinal, causing vomiting, diarrhoea, weight loss and lack of appetite. The less common form is cardiac, which attacks the heart muscles of very young puppies, often leading to death.

The majority of cases are seen in puppies between six weeks and six months old. The incidence of canine parvovirus infections has been reduced radically by early vaccination in young puppies.
How do I avoid my dog getting canine parvovirus?
The best prevention you can take against CPV infection is to vaccinate your dog and follow your vet’s advice carefully afterwards. Your puppy shouldn’t be socialised with other dogs until at least two weeks after their primary vaccinations.
How to spot if your dog has parvovirus

 	Severe bloody diarrhoea
 	Lethargy
 	Inappetence
 	Fever
 	Vomiting
 	Severe weight loss
 How is CPV treated and what are the costs?
Since the disease is a viral infection, there’s unfortunately no real cure for it. Treatment is focused on curing symptoms and preventing secondary bacterial infections. Intravenous fluid and nutrition therapy will maintain a dog’s normal body fluid after severe diarrhoea and dehydration.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start any treatments.
How do I stop parvovirus reoccurring in my dog?
Even after your dog has recovered from a CPV infection, they’ll still have a weakened immune system and will be susceptible to other illnesses.
Your dog will also continue to be a risk to other dogs for at least two months after their initial recovery - you’ll need to isolate your dog from other dogs for at least this period of time. When your dog recovers, they’ll have long-term immunity against the parvovirus, but this isn’t a guarantee they'll never be infected again.
If you’re thinking of adopting a dog with parvovirus
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new dog and ask for more details on how the infection was treated.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment.
How do I avoid arthritis reoccurring in my pet?
Arthritis is a progressive condition, so your pet will need ongoing treatment such as pain relief and follow up x-rays to monitor joint degeneration. It’s very important to manage your pet’s weight if they’re arthritic. Hydrotherapy can also be very beneficial and regular gentle exercise is recommended.

How to spot if your pet has diabetes,"This means their body will not be able to use glucose as an efficient source of energy and will instead start to breakdown important fats.
What are the signs of diabetes in pets?
The most common clinical signs seen in diabetic dogs and cats are:

 	Increased urination - increased blood glucose levels mean that glucose spills over into the urine drawing water with it, creating a larger volume of urine
 	Increased thirst - to compensate for the water that is being lost through increased urination
 	Weight loss
 	Increased appetite - not always present, but very noticeable in some dogs and cats

How is pet diabetes treated?
If your dog or cat is diabetic, you can treat them with an insulin injection, usually once or twice per day. Keep their day to day routines, feeding, activity, and body weight as constant as possible to minimise fluctuations in insulin.

Once a diabetic pet is stable, their dose of insulin may still need to be adjusted occasionally - only do this in consultation with your vet.

Your vet will want to monitor your diabetic pet. From time to time they will:

 	Check blood samples to look at blood glucose and fructosamine
 	Check the weight of your pet
 	Check urine samples for glucose and ketones (which are used as an alternative source of energy during diabetes)
 	Check the general health of your pet

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting treatment.

To help you and your vet manage the diabetes, keep a daily diary of your pet’s condition. Looking at the trends and changes can be extremely helpful in managing their diabetes.
How do I manage my pet’s diabetes?
Diabetes is a lifelong condition that will need daily management – unfortunately there’s no cure.

Some dogs and cats can have transient diabetes, where the condition goes into remission. This sometimes happens when a pet loses excess weight and their body produces its own insulin again. If this happens to your pet you should monitor the situation closely – diabetes can reoccur at any time.
If you’re thinking of adopting a pet with diabetes

Dry eye - what you need to know,"This results in severe drying and inflammation of the cornea (the transparent front part of the eye) and conjunctiva (the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye).

Dry eye is rare in cats but is relatively common in dogs, particularly Cocker Spaniels, Bulldogs, West Highland White Terriers, Lhasa Apsos and Shih Tzus. Females may be more likely to suffer from dry eye than males.
How to spot dry eye in your pets
The symptoms of dry eye include the following - contact your vet if you’re concerned about your pet.

 	Excessive blinking
 	Swollen blood vessels in the eye
 	Swelling of the tissue that lines the eyelids and surface of the eye
 	Prominent ‘third eyelid’
 	Discharge of mucus or pus from the eye
 	Ulceration and colour change in the cornea
 	Severe disease can lead to impaired or complete loss of vision

How is dry eye diagnosed in pets?
If you’re concerned your pet may have dry eye, your vet will carry out a Schirmer tear test. This measures tear production and the amount of wetness on the eye - a low amount indicates dry eye. A non-invasive dye that shows details of the eye under blue light can be used to examine your pet's eye for abrasions/ulcerations.
How do I treat my pet’s dry eye
You can use artificial-tear medications and lubricants to replace your pet’s tears - these are prescribed by your vet. You’ll need to clean your dog's eyes before you administer the medication, keeping them free of dried discharge.

It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start any treatment.

Anti-freeze poisoning in cats,"Anti-freeze contains the chemical Ethylene Glycol which cats in particular find very palatable, as it tastes sweet. It is, in fact, extremely poisonous to them and can be lethal if ingested. Even a small amount can prove fatal, and it’s thought that walking through a spillage and then cleaning their paws could be enough to cause serious illness, or even death.
When filling up your car or de-icing your windows, be sure to mop up any spillages, and store it in a sealed, labelled container, out of your pets’ reach.
While it may be relatively easy to keep your car de-icer away from prying paws, there is another worrying trend putting pets’ lives at risk, as anti-freeze is now commonly used to stop garden water features from freezing in the colder months. Cats, dogs, other small animals and birds, may be inclined to drink from these features. If you have a water feature in your garden, please do not use anti-freeze to keep it defrosted. To stop the water from freezing, try floating a ping pong ball in it instead.

What to do if your cat has ingested anti-freeze
If you suspect your pet could be a victim of anti-freeze poisoning it’s vital to seek veterinary help immediately. 
Signs to look out for include:


 	lethargic (very sleepy and may seem depressed)
 	uncoordinated (wobbly on its feet)
 	drinking and urinating to excess
 	seizures (fitting)
 	rapid, shallow breathing  with a racing heartbeat
 	retching and/or vomiting
 	lack of appetite.
          "
What to do if your pet has an abnormal gait,"It can be caused by compression of the spinal cord, imbalance of the inner ear or uncoordinated motor activity.
What are the signs?

 	Weakness of the limbs
 	May affect one, two, or all of the limbs
 	May affect only the hind legs, or the legs on one side of the body
 	Tilting head to one side
 	Trouble hearing – non-responsive to being called to at normal voice pitch
 	Stumbling, tipping over, swaying
 	Excessive drowsiness or stupor
 	Changes in behaviour
 	Abnormal eye movements – may be due to false feeling of movement, vertigo
 	Lack of appetite due to nausea (symptom of motion sickness from loss of balance)

How is ataxia diagnosed?
If you suspect your pet’s abnormal gait may be ataxia, your vet will carry out standard tests – including a blood chemical profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel.

Your vet may also perform X-rays and an ultrasound to view the spine and internal organs. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.
How is ataxia treated?
Your pet is likely to be treated on an outpatient basis, unless the ataxia is severe or the cause of the ataxia is life threatening. Avoid giving any medication to your pet without first consulting with your vet – some medication can either contribute to the problem or disguise the underlying condition that is causing it.

Your vet will base your pet’s treatment on the underlying cause of the disease. Keep and eye on your pet for increasing dysfunction or weakness. If their condition worsens, contact your vet immediately.
If you’re thinking of adopting a pet with ataxia
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new pet and ask for more details on how the condition has been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any pet who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.          "
Why is my dog scratching?,"What are the signs of skin inflammation in dogs?

 	Itching
 	Scratching
 	Rubbing
 	Licking, especially around the face, paws, and underarms.

How is atopic dermatitis diagnosed in dogs?
Your vet will need a complete medical history to determine the underlying cause of your pet’s skin allergies, including a physical examination. They may perform a serologic allergy test, but this doesn’t always have reliable results.
How is atopic dermatitis in dogs treated?
Medicines such as corticosteroids and antihistamines can be given to control or reduce your pet’s itching. Cyclosporine is effective in controlling itching from long-term skin allergies.

Sprays can also be used over large areas of your pet’s body to control their itching with minimal side effects. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.
How do I avoid skin inflammation reoccurring?
Unfortunately, the atopic dermatitis may never completely go away. Once treatment has begun, your vet should see your pet every 2 to 8 weeks to keep an eye on the effectiveness of the treatment.

Once your pet's itching is under control, your vet will want to see them every 3 to 12 months for check-ups. If your vet finds the trigger for your pet's allergies, they will advise you what to do to avoid it.

How to sell a pet responsibly,"While rescue centres are here to help, some owners cannot bring themselves to put their pet into a rescue centre/kennel situation where their future will be decided by strangers, and some dogs also find kennels extremely stressful.

Please be aware that as of the 6 April 2020, Lucy's Law came into practice, a legislation which bans the third-party selling of puppies and kittens under 6-months old. 

Many rescues will not take in pets with serious behavioral issues, or want to house too many dogs of the same breed type, which might concern some pet owners. You should always try contacting a rehoming centre first, and although they may not be able to take your pet in straight away, it's worth it to protect the future of your pet. If you're worried about your pet being in a shelter environment, Woodgreen can find them a new owner whilst they stay with you - as well as having a network of foster carers who care for pets in a home environment.

If selling your pet still seems like the option for you, here's a few questions and considerations to think about before getting started.
Dogs

 	Prior to advertising, it is best to ensure that your dog is neutered so that it cannot be used for breeding.
 	Be sure to ask questions regarding what the dog’s daily routine would be – does it match what the dog has already? Is it an improvement?
 	Will your dog be compatible to live with any other dogs, cats, or small pets in their new home?
 	Does your dog need a secure garden? If so, we recommend asking to see pictures of the garden in the potential new home.
 	How long will the new owners be leaving the dog home alone? Is the amount of time acceptable?
 	If possible, it’s best to ask for proof of address.
 	If your dog has an ongoing medical condition, you must let a potential new owner know as this can lead to financial concerns.
 	Are you in a position to take your dog back if it doesn’t work out during the first few weeks?
 	Are the new owners happy to keep in touch and give you updates?
 	It is always advisable after the first meet to give the potential new owners a ‘cooling off period’ to ensure their commitment.

Please be aware that a number of dogs that enter rescues are dogs that have originally been purchased online, but the rehoming unfortunately hasn’t worked out.
Cats

 	Prior to advertising, it is best to ensure that your cat is neutered to prevent breeding or unwanted litters in the future. Neutering also reduces the risk of fighting, wandering, and lowers the risk of many viruses.
 	Is your cat able to live with other animals? Do you know if they have had any negative experiences with other animals that may affect them in another home?
 	Is your cat used to living with children? If it is known that your cat has had problems in the past and has shown aggressive type behaviours to children, the new owners need to be aware and suitable judgement made.
 	Is your cat used to having outdoor access or may require outdoor access in the new home? For many cats, restricting outdoor access can lead to them being unhappy and having behavioural problems.
 	Are there any ongoing medical issues with your cat? The new owners need to be aware of these and the potential financial increases that may occur.
 	Are you able to take the cat back if the new home doesn’t work out during the first few weeks?
 	It is always advisable after the first meet to give the potential new owners a ‘cooling off period’ to ensure their commitment.

Small pets

 	Prior to advertising, it is best to ensure that your small pet is in good health. Rabbits, ferrets, and male guinea pigs should be neutered prior to rehoming to prevent them being used for unnecessary breeding.
 	Many of the small pet species prefer to live with a companion of the same species. For example, rabbits should be in neutered pairs. If your pet is currently living on its own, consider a new owner who can responsibly pair up your pet you are rehoming to avoid them being on their own for any longer. Many rescue centers offer a mixing service for most small pets.
 	Don’t offer your small pet for free. Whilst there can be many well-meaning new owners keen to take on your pet, some can have ill intentions such as feeding reptiles live food, which is illegal in the UK.
 	If you are selling your pet without accommodation, always ensure the new owner can provide adequate space with plenty of enrichment. Feel free to talk to Woodgreen or your local rescue regarding advice on recommended enclosure sizes, and ask to see photos or visit the new owners facilities first to ensure it is as they say it is.
 	Does the new owner have existing pets, and do they have experience with these species? Remember that many of small pets are prey species and can find living alongside species such as cats and dogs very stressful.
 	Some of the small pet species can live for up to 20 years, require regular vaccinations and regular general health checks. Are they aware of this, and are they able to commit to the pet’s needs?
 	If possible, it’s best to ask for proof of address.
 	If your pet has an ongoing medical condition, you must let a potential new owner know as this can lead to financial concerns or unknown suffering to the pet.
 	Are you in a position to take your pet back if it doesn’t work out during the first few weeks?
 	Are the new owners happy to keep in touch and give you updates?
 	It is always advisable after the first meet to give the potential new owners a ‘cooling off period’ to ensure their commitment.

An introduction to hamsters,"Did you know, there are five main domestic breeds of hamster? These include: the Syrian (most common and largest), the Winter White, Campbell, the Chinese and Roborovski hamster. Each breed comes with their own quirky personality traits, habits and appearance. Hamsters can make a lovely addition to any family.
Our helpful guide covers everything from companionship, health, accommodation, how to handle your hamster and more. We hope this will help you with your decision about rehoming a hamster and which breed is right for you.

Hamster companionship
All breeds except the Syrian and Chinese hamster can live with another of the same breed, however tensions often rise if the accommodation is too small or there aren’t enough resources for both of them. For this reason, many hamsters prefer to live the single life.

Health and life expectancy of hamsters
Hamsters are generally healthy animals and can live up to the age of three. Most illness come with old age or poor care.

Housing your hamster
Syrian hamsters like to climb and travel large distances, so they need a large cage with plenty of space for them to roam and levels for them to explore. The bigger the better! The ideal size is an 80cm wide by 50cm deep by 50 cm high with a 1cm bar spacing.

All other breeds of hamster require less height but still need plenty of floor space as they prefer to cover a lot of ground level. The ideal size is an 80cm wide by 50cm deep by 35 cm high cage with a 6mm bar spacing.

Feeding your hamster
Hamsters are omnivores, they require a well-balanced diet of seeds, grains, vegetables, pulses and meat sources. Feeding your hamster a good quality, complete dry mix will provide the essential nutrients they need to keep them healthy.
As natural foragers, they like to look for their food so it’s worth scattering their daily allowance around their enclosure rather than feeding them from a bowl. To keep them interested in their food, it’s worth introducing a variety of healthy treats in moderation. These include:

 	Raw or cooked pasta
 	Fresh fruits and vegetables including broccoli, curly kale, strawberries and grapes
 	Small amount of boiled eggs
 	Pulses and cereals
 	Fresh mealworms – one or two at a time, unless their dry food already includes this
 	Apple wood or other fruit tree wood for them to gnaw on
 	Dried herbs including mountain and garden mix – Supreme Petfoods have a variety of dried food for hamsters on their website.
 	Dog biscuits such as gravy bones
 	Avoid water supplements, fatty or colourful chew sticks and mineral and salt blocks. These can cause more harm than good so it’s best to stick to healthy, natural treats.


Are hamsters family-friendly pets?
Yes! Hamsters can make a lovely first-time pet for calm and patient children who are interested in learning about how to care for an animal. New hamsters and babies may be nervous at first, especially if they haven’t been handled much, so it’s worth giving them time to settle when you first bring them home.

Hamsters are nocturnal so they will sleep more in the day and be active at night. If you live in a busy household with lots of comings and goings, it’s worth bearing in mind, they may not appreciate being woken up.

The safest way to socialise your hamster is to place a short tunnel in front of them to encourage them to walk in, and let them come out to investigate you in their own time. This can be done on the floor of a secure room or in a bath.
Handling your hamster
Hamster enjoy being handled from time to time but it’s important to take extra care so they feel supported and comfortable.

 	Cup your hands under the hamster and gently lift them towards your body.
 	Syrian hamsters can be gently picked up by placing one hand behind their front legs and supporting their rear end with the other. This should only be done once your hamster feels comfortable being picked up regularly using the cupping method.
 	For the first few weeks, sit on the floor and allow your hamster to walk over each hand or sit in your lap.

Always try to place them back in the cage whilst they are still relaxed and happy with the situation rather than when they become irritable. Otherwise this will become a learned behaviour of how to get you to leave them alone.

Once they’re happy with you, you can slowly practice picking them up from your lap and placing them back down again. After one to two weeks of this calm and patient approach, you’ll find your hamster is quite happy to be picked up, handled and hand fed.
Roborovski hamsters and handling
Roborovski hamsters are incredibly fast and because of this, it’s very tricky to regularly handle them, especially by young children. Due to their exceptionally small size, they’re also difficult to pick up. Their fast and sudden movements could result in an injury, so it’s best to just enjoy watching them rather than picking them up.
Transporting your hamsters
Make sure you have a suitable pet carrier available for when you need to take your hamster to the vet or when cleaning their cage. To keep your hamster relaxed and happy at this time, place some of the bedding in the base of the carrier along with a little house or tunnel. Lastly, scatter a small amount of food around the carrier for your hamster to enjoy.

Chinchillas: your day-to-day guide,"However, remember they are more active at dusk and dawn – this may not suit all families. Find out how to care for your chinchillas day-to-day below.

What to feed your chinchillas
Chinchillas are herbivores – so they only eat plant-based food, not meat. Feed your chinchillas a good quality diet to avoid health conditions like dental disease and obesity.


 	Your chinchilla’s diet should be made up of around 80% good quality hay varieties – such as meadow hay, alfalfa, orchard grass – and small amounts of timothy hay
 	5% should be pellet feed like Burgess chinchilla nuggets. One to two tablespoons of nuggets a day is ample for one to two chinchillas
 	15% natural, healthy forage treats should top up the last of your chinchillas’ diet. Take care to choose healthy treats as it can be very easy to over feed sugary treats, which will lead to health problems.

Healthy treats for chinchillas 

 	Apple, pear or willow tree twigs and branch cuttings
 	Wild rose, ideally remove any large thorns
 	Dried herbs and seed pods purchased from a pet store such as the mountain mix or mallow root
 How to handle your chinchillas
Chinchillas are naturally fast and wriggly animals, and many don’t enjoy being handled. Spend time slowly socialising your chinchillas to help them feel safe and confident around you, and they may learn to enjoy being handled in their own time.
Spend 10-20 minutes each evening talking to your chinchillas and offering them a treat to encourage them to feed from your hands. Once they feel confident with this, offer them your arm to sniff and hop onto. Never try to grab your chinchilla suddenly as this can cause them a lot of stress.
If you need to catch your chinchillas for health checking or during free-range time, place a tunnel out for them to get into. This way, you can safely lift them without causing them stress.
When you need to handle your chinchillas for a health check or to give treatment, hold them against your chest with all four of their feet on you. Hold up the very base of their tail across their shoulders with your other hand. Never pick your chinchilla up by the tail.

How to avoid biting
It’s relatively rare that your chinchillas will bite you. However, not all enjoy human contact and will give you plenty of warnings before biting. These warnings include barking, spitting and urinating at you.
If you notice these warnings, leave your chinchillas to relax and settle in their home and take your time to socialise with them.

Free-range time
Once your chinchillas are settled with your daily routine and happy to feed from your hands, you can allow them some free-range time in a secure room.
Ideally, this is the room that the cage is housed in. Make sure all wires are protected and any house plants are removed. Your chinchillas will run fast and spring all over the place exploring, so make sure the room is completely safe and secure.         "
How to make your chinchillas feel at home,"Providing your chinchillas with suitable spacious housing – with chinchilla-friendly toys and activities – will help keep them active, happy and healthy.
Creating the right environment for your chinchillas
Chinchillas can be very sensitive to the wrong environment, so choose their location carefully. Ideally, the room temperature should be around 10-15°C. They are used to colder, and will not tolerate high temperatures – leading to large amounts of moulting, lack of interest in food and lethargy.

Consider the room they are in. Chinchillas are active at dawn and dusk, and will benefit from a room with low traffic noise levels. Don’t place the cage next to a window or a radiator.
The ideal cage design for a pair of chinchillas
Choose a cage with a solid metal base - plastic or mesh can cause injury and discomfort. Minimum sizes:

 	Bar spacing: 12-14mm
 	Depth: 63cm
 	Width: 93cm
 	Height: 159cm

Keep your chinchilla happy and occupied
Chinchillas are very active and enjoy items in their cage that they can chew and jump on. It is very important to furnish the cage with safe items that your chinchillas can’t injure themselves on.
Your chinchillas will enjoy:

 	Twigs, stumps and branches from apple, pear or willow trees for them to chew and jump on
 	Wooden boxes for them to sleep in
 	Wooden platforms. Chinchillas love to jump from level to level – these are great for breaking up the space and preventing falls from a height. They also enjoy having a snooze on these!
 	Ceramic or hard card tunnels – make sure there are no broken or sharp edges to prevent any injuries. If your chinchilla is prone to chewing card, avoid using card tunnels to reduce the risk of gastro intestinal tract blockages.
 	Dust bath in a metal tray. Allow your chinchillas access to a dust bath using chinchilla sand several times a week to keep their fur and skin healthy. Place the tray in their cage for 24 hours at a time or when you give them some free-range time. Avoid leaving it in all the time as they may start using it as a toilet.
 	Hammocks made from anti-pill fleece.  Like the wooden platforms, these are great for allowing your chinchilla to jump around different levels and for providing a break to prevent the chinchilla falling from height.

Avoid these chinchilla toys:

 	Ladders are not safe for chinchillas as they can cause leg injuries
 	Hanging toys such as parrot or rodent ropes and swings. As chinchillas are very fast and reactive, they can damage their legs or become caught on hanging items
 	Plastic toys will be destroyed very quickly and may become dangerous. Chinchillas may ingest the plastic or injure themselves on sharp edges.
 	Any toys that the chinchillas may trap their legs in while jumping about
 	Take extra care and monitor individual chinchillas with items that can easily be chewed such as card, paper or fleece/material enrichment as these can pose a risk of gastro intestinal tract blockages if aloud to ingest these substances.

Choosing the right chinchilla bedding
Make sure your chinchillas have a nice, soft bedding base for their cage, rather than using a mesh floor. This will avoid injury to their feet and help meet their natural behavioural and environmental needs.

There are many bedding options available and many views on the safest option. It all comes down to the individual. All chinchillas are different; some will interact with the substrate and others will totally ignore it.

Your chinchillas will often choose to sleep either on a platform or inside a box or hammock. Provide them with options by lining some of these with soft, good quality hay. On warmer days your chinchillas may choose to sleep out on the bare platforms.
Here are some options:

 	Soft, short meadow hay - not only is it soft, it also allows them to naturally forage for food as chinchillas need to eat hay as part of their diet.
 	Hemp bedding – can be used in litter trays or as a substrate on the whole base of the cage.
 	Fleece base – fleece is fast becoming a very popular choice of bedding for chinchillas. However, care should still be taken to monitor for damage to the fabric which could cause a leg injury or potential plastic fibre blockage. Anti-pill fleece is the only type of fleece safe to use with chinchillas. Fleece will need changing every day or two and laundered to prevent your chinchillas sitting in wet bedding which could cause skin issues.
 	Short chopped shredded paper – similar to fleece, chopped shredded paper should be monitored and always look out for signs that your chinchilla may be eating it.  Although most will show little interest, some might ingest it. If this is the case, an alternative choice of bedding should be provided. You should also review their enrichment items and feeding method. Encourage your chinchillas to chew safe items by providing plenty of safe options and take more time foraging for food.

Never use wood shavings or sawdust for your chinchillas. These can be very dusty and are a common cause of skin related illnesses. Avoid paper fibre confetti type bedding as these can be very dangerous if ingested by your chinchillas. How to clean out your chinchillas
Clean your chinchillas’ cage out weekly to help keep them in good health.

Each day, use a small dustpan and brush to sweep the platforms and any areas with a build-up of poo to prevent illness.

If you are using anti-pill fleece as the lining of the cage, these will need to be removed and replaced with clean, laundered fleece every day or two, depending on how messy your chinchillas are.

When doing a full clean, always use a pet-safe disinfectant to clean the cage. Take the opportunity to add a few new toys in the cage for interest, like a new apple branch or box for your chinchilla to explore.         "
Keeping your pets safe at Christmas,"Keeping cats safe at Christmas
Ensure that your cats have their own safe space, especially if large groups of people are coming over.

Giving the cat the choice to have some hiding places and spaces up high means they can watch what is happening from a safe distance, but also choose to come out if they wish.

If your pets enjoy being outside a lot, then it might be worth considering a warm, dry area that they can take shelter in if needed.

Your cat’s litter trays, food and water should be kept in a quiet area where they won’t be disturbed. Be sure to keep the litter tray and their eating area separate!
Keeping dogs safe at Christmas
A house full of visitors over the Christmas period has a tendency to be quite busy and noisy, and this can be a worrying experience for dogs.

Many dogs are also scared of the sound of party poppers or crackers being pulled. During large family gatherings, it’s always a good idea to provide the dog with a safe space where no one will disturb them.

While a 'home alone box' is not a substitute for human companionship, it can help your dog to cope in periods where they'll be left home alone for short periods of time while you are visiting friends or family. Find out how to build the perfect 'home alone box'.
Keeping small pets safe at Christmas
Fireworks tend to be lit around Christmas and New Years Eve, and this can be a terrifying experience for many pets. For those outdoor small pets such as rabbits and guinea pigs, it’s best to ensure that they have their own safe space with plenty of bedding and hiding places.

Family and friends visiting can be stressful. Move accommodation to avoid stress from unexpected noise or poor handling from visitors.
Food

 	Although it’s tempting to treat our pets at Christmas to the same kind of tasty food we eat, we must remember that this can cause them to have an upset stomach, and could lead to your pet gaining weight.
 	Chocolate contains theobromine, while sweets can contain an artificial sweetener called xylitol – both are toxic for dogs, so be mindful to place any sweet treats out of reach from your pooch, along with mince pies!
 	Avoid purchasing Christmas treats filled with colourants and unnatural ingredients – they can cause obesity and digestive issues.

Some festive plants are toxic to pets

 	Be mindful about what plants you put on display during the festive season. Some plants, such as poinsettias, holly berries, ivy, mistletoe, lillies, and rosemary can be toxic for your pets - they can cause gastrointestinal upset, or kidney failure if consumed.
 	Keep foliage decorations such as wreaths, table displays, and Christmas trees out of reach of any free-ranging small pets, as many are made of plants that are toxic to animals.

Christmas trees and other decorations

 	Some pets - kittens especially, enjoy climbing Christmas trees. We recommend keeping the tree out of reach, or securely tie the tree to ensure it doesn't fall over. Hanging edible decorations, like chocolate, are poisonous to dogs and can cause health issues. If you are worried that your dog has consumed any chocolate during the festive season, please contact your vet immediately.
 	Also be aware that many pets might be tempted to chew or play with decorations, especially those that are lower down the tree. Non-glass tree decorations are best, to avoid any smashed glass if your pet has managed to get hold of one.
 	Tinsel and wrapping paper might be tempting for a pet to play with, but can cause some difficulties in your pet's digestive system if consumed. They should be supervised to ensure that none is swallowed.
 	If your pet is prone to chewing, please be mindful of your Christmas tree lights, as there is a risk of electrocution if a cat chews through them.

Presents

 	Presents that contain small pieces are at risk of being swallowed by some pets, and should be placed out of reach if your pet is prone to chewing.
 	If you, your friends or family are gifted food items, it's best to keep these out of reach of your pets.
 Cold weather

 	If you’re looking to take a Christmas walk with your dog, it is worth noting that salt rather than grit when used on walking surfaces can make a dogs pads very sore, especially if they have a cut or graze on them.
 	Keeping the hair between your dog’s toes short helps to reduce the risk of ice balls forming and causing discomfort in that area. Keeping dogs away from frozen lakes or rivers will also ensure they remain safe.

Feline Herpes Virus (FHV) - what you need to know,"
FHV is highly contagious and can be transmitted between cats through direct contact, contaminated food bowls, bedding or even as an airborne virus through sneeze droplets.

How to spot if your cat has FHV
The signs of FHV are usually the following. Talk to your vet if you’re concerned about your cat.


 	Upper respiratory tract infections
 	Keratitis (inflammation and infection of the cornea)
 	FHV associated dermatitis

How is FHV treated?
Your vet will prescribe antibiotics and in some cases intravenous fluids will be required. Some anti-viral medication can help in managing the disease.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start treatment.

How do I protect my cat from FHV?
Vaccination is the most effective from of preventative care from FHV. Your vet can advise you on this.

 How do I avoid FHV reoccurring?
After being infected with FHV, most cats remain latently infected. This means the virus persists in their nerve cells, so infected cats effectively become life-long carriers of the virus. It’s vital that you keep your cat’s litter trays and bedding clean to prevent the spread of FHV.
Many cats don’t spread the virus so aren’t a risk to others. However, some cats will intermittently spread the virus again – this is more common after episodes of stress or when the cat's immune system is suppressed. When virus is spread again, some cats will also develop mild clinical signs.

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with FHV
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new cat and ask for more details on how the disease was treated.  You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any cat who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
Make your own: snuffle mat," 
You will need:

 	One rubber holed grid/mat, such as a sink or doormat. Here's an example.
 	Two or three fleece blankets.
 	Stanley knife (optional, if you plan to reduce the size of the mat)
 	A pair of scissors.

What to do:
1. If you have purchased a doormat, cut down to the size you prefer. A sink mat will be fine though!
2. Cut your fleece blankets into strips using scissors. Cutting these at different widths and lengths will make the snuffle mat a bit more of a challenge for your dog.
3. Tie your strips to onto your mat in a single-knot (like you would when tying a shoelace). Start horizontally, then when a row is completed, start tying diagonally on the next row.
4. Tie another horizontal row again, followed by the next row diagonally. Complete this until the whole grid has been filled.
5. Scatter some tasty treats across the snuffle mat, making sure to hide some, before giving to your dog. Your dog will then enjoy sniffing out their food!

How to house your rabbits," The ideal enclosure size for a pair of rabbits

 	Hutch – 6 ft long by 2 ft deep (183 cm by 61 cm). This is suitable for small to medium breed rabbits
 	Shed or wooden Wendy House – 5 ft by 5 ft (153 cm by 153 cm)
 	Exercise run – 3m long by 2m wide by 1m high. This will need to be permanently and securely attached to the hutch or shed allowing your rabbits the choice to move between the two

Groups will require a bigger space depending on their breed and activity level.
Our video below will help you:  
Your rabbits' hutch
You'll find many rabbit hutches available in pet stores and online. However, many are very poorly made and often fall apart within the first two years. You should consider investing a little more with a welfare-approved company, where the rabbit hutch is made of strong wood and suitable bolts have been fitted on the doors.
Double-level hutches are not ideal for rabbits. Your rabbits can be at risk of falling down the ramp or floor hole when they are elderly and less mobile. If you choose this option, build a banister along the ramp and around the top-level hole to aid them.
Wooden Wendy Houses or garden sheds can make an ideal home for your rabbits. You can easily convert them with mesh doors and a step-over barrier to stop them escaping. A shed gives your rabbits more floor space, and means it's easier to socialise with their rabbits whatever the weather.
Whether you’re planning to buy a rabbit hutch or build your own, carry out regular inspections on your rabbits' accommodation to check for damage from poor weather conditions.

How to give your dog a bath,"

Unless you’re told to by a vet, don’t give your dog a bath too often as you will remove the natural oils from the skin which help in waterproofing and insulation.
Top dog bathing tips

 	Always use a dog shampoo, as human shampoo can damage the dogs coat and skin
 	Use a non-slip mat on the bottom of the bath to prevent your dog from slipping and sliding
 	Use lukewarm water and ensure you wet the coat thoroughly before adding the shampoo
 	Start shampooing the back and neck area then move on to the tail and bottom, then the legs and feet. Lastly wash the head area. Try to avoid getting shampoo into the dog’s eyes
 	Let your dog become accustomed to the noise of a hair dryer before using it on them, and keep it on a cool heat

Finally, have treats available for your dog to help make the whole experience a more positive one. Happy bathing!

Covid-19: can you over-exercise your dog?,"
This is great news for our mental health and physical fitness, but what about our dogs?
Most dogs require two walks a day of around 40 mins each time. These walks generally consist of on and off-lead exercise.
While it might be a great excuse for every member of the household to enjoy some time outdoors with their dog, excessive exercise could cause both physical and mental issues for your pooch. Remember, an overtired dog can be a grumpy dog.
If you obtained a puppy or young adult dog, you need to be careful not to put too much strain on their soft and growing joints. Over-exercising a pup that hasn’t finished growing can lead to development issues as they get older.
At the other end of the scale, older dogs start to feel aches and pains. If they are stiff after resting following a walk, they are doing too much and may well need some pain relief to keep them comfortable.
Some breeds can cope with more exercise than others. Their shape and size often dictates just how far they can go. Consider what your chosen breed was bred to do for an idea of how much stamina they may have. Short-nosed breeds 'for example' often struggle with long walks due to their inability to breathe properly.
With the weather getting warmer, we all need to take great care not to exercise our dogs during the hottest part of the day (10am-6pm). All dogs struggle in hot weather, and the consequences of not recognising this can lead to tragic consequences.
And finally, dogs are creatures of habit, they thrive on routine. If or when you return to work, and further down the line, resume a busier social life, you need to consider how such a big change to your dog's exercise routine will affect them. To get started, here's how to make an activity box which may make the transition a little easier.

How to make your rabbits feel at home,"Rabbits naturally live underground, so they will also be busy digging and exploring suitable burrow options. Wild rabbits will always choose to be close to at least two to three boltholes they can escape to if they feel threatened.

When creating your rabbits’ environment, try to choose items that will encourage and support this natural behaviour. This will keep them active and mentally stimulate them so they remain healthy and happy.
Keep your rabbits happy and occupied
A suitable, neutered rabbit companion is very important. A lone rabbit, or one with an unsuitable companion, will often remain very nervous and reluctant to come out and explore. In some cases, a single rabbit may become aggressive towards you.

Rabbits feel safe when they have plenty of areas to run into or hide. Provide your rabbits with several shelters – plastic tables and chairs, card boxes, card or plastic tunnels and even plastic cat carriers lined with newspaper and hay. Fruit tree or willow logs make great look out towers. Rabbits love to jump on them and survey their territory.
Rabbits love litter trays

 	Dig trays are a rabbit’s favourite thing. Fill large cat litter trays or large tray bases from indoor cages with play sand or organic soil – your rabbits will dig to their hearts’ content
 	Cat litter trays lined with newspaper and filled with hay are really important – have at least three of these in corners for them to use as a toilet. Rabbits like to nibble on hay whilst using their toilet, so clean them daily so they don’t eat dirty hay
 	For rabbits living indoors or on concrete, fill plant pots and large litter trays with safe plants and growing grass. Place these in their enclosure for them to nibble at their leisure
 Food can be fun too

 	Hay kebabs and forage trees: Simply take two cardboard toilet rolls and stuff one end with their favourite hay, add some dried or fresh forage into the centre and enclose with more hay. Take a willow stick and pass through the middle of the rolls. Place several of these into an empty cardboard box to make a forage tree
 	Forage bags: Half fill a paper bag with hay or dried grass, mix in some dried or fresh forage and give the whole bag to your rabbits - make sure you tear off the handle first. No rabbit can resist a rustling paper bag!
 	Stick bundles: Take 10 – 12 willow or apple sticks and tie tightly around the middle. Hang them from the sides of the run for your rabbits to reach up and enjoy
 	Plant pots: Mix some hay and dried or fresh forage into a plant pot and turn it upside down. Watch as your rabbits have fun trying to get to the treats
 	Herb planters: Grow herbs such as mint or lemon balm in a plant pot and attach an upturned hanging basket over the top. Your rabbits will nibble the herbs while they are growing but not destroy the plant’s roots
 	Mock hedges: These are garden hanging baskets or magazine racks completely stuffed with hay to avoid legs getting trapped. You can hang them up in the run to encourage your rabbit to reach up and browse
 	Gnawing twigs: Rabbits need to be able to gnaw on items to keep their teeth in good shape. Often, rabbits do not enjoy wooden chew toys as the tasty bark has been removed. Try offering apple tree or willow twigs as they love to chew all the bark off, plus it’s great for their digestive system!

What to do if your cat has acne,"
Some cats may only have a single case of acne while others have a life-long, recurring problem.
Acne in cats can be caused by poor grooming habits or abnormalities in your cat's skin, oil production or immune-barrier function. It can also be caused by excessive grooming where the chin is repeatedly rubbed on the fur.

What are the signs of acne in cats?
Symptoms of acne can include blackheads or whiteheads, mild red pimples, watery crusts that can develop on the chin and (less commonly) lips, and swelling of your cat’s chin.
In more severe cases, your cat may develop nodules, bleeding crusts, pustules, hair loss, a severe redness of the skin and be in pain, which can indicate boils.

Cat acne treatment - How is cat acne treated?
Your vet may perform skin scraping to look for mites and fungal infected hairs or take a fungal culture. A microscopic examination of the cells and a biopsy is rarely needed but is sometimes necessary.
The treatment consists of regular cleaning of the infected area with an antiseptic cleanser, plus antibiotics and topical shampoos. This should help to clear the acne.
If the outbreaks of acne reduce as a result of this treatment, gradually reduce it over a two-to three-week period. If the acne is continual throughout the treatment or reoccurs frequently, your vet will give you a regular cleaning schedule. Life-long treatment, twice a week, is sometimes necessary.
If there is a bacterial infection on the skin, your vet will prescribe oral antibiotics. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.

 
How do I avoid cat acne reoccurring?
After the treatment is discontinued, monitor your cat for relapses. Maintenance cleansing programs can also be used to extend the time between episodes of acne.

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with acne
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new cat and ask for more details on how the condition has been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any cat who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.

Give Staffies a Chance,"Sadly in recent years, the Staffie’s physical similarities with pit bulls means people are often wrongly frightened of them. Sensationalism in the media leads to people overlooking or avoiding this once loved and treasured breed.

That’s why we launched the ‘Give Staffies a Chance’ campaign. Rehoming centres like ours are seeing significant increases in the numbers of Staffies coming through our doors. If you’re thinking of rehoming a dog, consider rehoming a Staffie - they really do make excellent pets.  
Changing public opinion
We carried out a survey to 1,400 people, which revealed that 31% of people wouldn’t own a Staffie because they believe them to be dangerous, unpredictable and intimidating. The reality of owning a Staffie is very different.
What you can expect from owning a Staffie?
Staffies are devoted to their families – adults and children alike – and if you show a Staffie love and affection, you will get double the love back.

Contrary to popular belief, Staffies are surprisingly sensitive. They will crave your attention and companionship and will need a thick warm coat in cold and inclement weather. They want nothing more than to be your faithful best friend.
Training and socialisation
Staffies are extremely intelligent and enjoy learning new commands including sit, stay and heel. They can excel in many different canine disciplines such as obedience, agility, fly ball and rally-o. If they’re socialised from a young age they can be great playmates for other dogs.
Health and exercise
Staffies are strong, athletic, agile and active dogs that require daily walks and a regular routine. They are fun-loving and will happily spend hours playing pulling games or chasing a ball to fulfil their need of hard exercise, so you'll need plenty of free time and a good supply of toys!

How to make a 'hidey hole' for your cats,"


Hiding is perfectly normal cat behaviour. They enjoy quiet, enclosed spaces where they can snuggle up and feel safe and secure. It’s important to provide plenty of places in the home for your cat to retreat to when they want to relax or watch what’s going on without being seen.

A ‘hidey hole’ box will help your cat feel happy and settled in the home. All you need is two things, a t-shirt and a box!

Check out the video below for instructions and find out everything you need to get started:


  

You will need

 	T-shirt
 	Cardboard box (make sure it’s big enough for your cat to sit comfortably in and turn around )


What to do

 	Stand the empty cardboard box up so the opening is facing you. You can either fold the tabs down or cut them off.
 	Grab your t-shirt and pull it tight over the outside of the box.
 	Make sure the neck of the t-shirt is at the opening of the box.
 	Flip the box over, gather the excess fabric at the bottom of the box and tie it off with string, in a knot, or if you have a bit more time and you’re handy with a sewing needle, you can sew it closed for a professional finish.
 	Fold the sleeves towards the bottom of the box.
 	Place the box on its side and pop a blanket inside for your cat. They be able to walk into their box whenever they like for a safe snooze.

5 reasons to own pet rats,"&nbsp;

 	They love to come out to play and adapt to your daily routine. Rats love to have some free-range time in a secure playroom where they can run, forage, climb and interact with their owners.
 	They are very intelligent! Rats are very inquisitive and love to learn. They are rather partial to a bit of agility, and learning a few tricks... as long as a tasty treat is on offer that is!
 	It is a misconception that rats are dirty. In fact, they spend many hours of the day busily cleaning and washing themselves, and even appreciate the use of a litter tray.
 	They give lovely cuddles. Everyone needs a cuddle, and rats happen to love snuggling into you for an evening in front of the TV.
 	They are great with children! Rats really adapt well to children, and get used to coming out to play in the morning and after school. Children can also have lots of fun getting creative and learning new skills, by making enrichment for their rat's cage. These can include hammocks, cardboard castles, tunnel mazes, rope ladders and rummage boxes.

How to know if you're ready for a cat,"
If you’re considering a cat as a pet, think carefully about current lifestyle and commitments. Also discuss this important decision with your family.
Here are some things you should consider:


 	Young kittens need a home with an owner who is there most of the day. They need regular play sessions and lots of socialisation to become a well rounded adult who can cope with different challenges in the future
 	Young kittens shouldn’t be left for longer than 4-5 hours as they need regular meals throughout the day and close monitoring. If you’re not able to feed your kitten 3-4 meals evenly spread throughout the day, look at rehoming an older cat
 	Most adult cats can be left alone for a working day quite happily, although there are always exceptions
 	It is important to allow your cat access to outside throughout the day so they can exhibit natural behaviour, including hunting prey. Think carefully about how you feel about this
 	As a general rule we don’t advise keeping cats as purely indoor pets, they should have the choice to go outside to avoid developing frustration issues. Again there are exceptions to this
 	If you work very long hours and are out of the house often, your home is probably not right for a cat at this time. Most cats require regular attention even if they have other animals for company.
 	If you travel or are away a lot, think about who will care for your pet in your absence

Dog vaccinations: what you need to know,"



By making sure they’re up to date with all their jabs you can relax and enjoy watching your puppy grow and develop.

Your dog should be vaccinated against:

 	Canine parvovirus, an aggressive disease that causes serious and often fatal vomiting and diarrhoea
 	Canine distemper, a virus that attacks the gut, lungs and nervous system and is usually fatal
 	Infectious canine hepatitis rapidly attacks the liver, lungs, kidneys and eyes, many cases are fatal
 	Canine parainfluenza virus, a highly contagious respiratory tract infection which causes a dry, hacking cough
 	Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria and can be treated by antibiotics, but is often fatal or can cause serious kidney damage

Your dog can also be vaccinated against:

 	Canine coronavirus - this is not Covid-19. Canine coronavirus is a long-established canine virus that causes diarrhoea. Please ask your vet for advice on your individual dogs circumstances.
 	Kennel cough (infectious bronchitis). Many boarding kennels insist on this before entry, ask your vet for more information
 	Rabies, if you want to travel abroad with your pet. Contact your vet or DEFRA for further information on the Pet Travel Scheme




When you should vaccinate your dog

 	Puppies should be vaccinated at about 8 weeks of age, and then a second dose around 10-12 weeks old is essential
 	Boosters should be given as your vet advises, usually every year.

What to do after vaccination
It is usually safe to take your puppy out in public a week after the second vaccination. However, you should balance this against the importance of socialising your puppy when they’re younger than this.
Consider taking them out to meet the world before they’re vaccinated, but keep them in your arms or go to places where there are no other dogs.

How to socialise your rabbit,"
Rabbits don’t enjoy being handled, but they are cheeky and intelligent. They’ll soon learn and enjoy taking treats from you and following you about.

Don’t expect cuddles from your rabbit
Although traditionally rabbits are a popular children’s pet, they are only really suited to families who will be happy to socialise with their rabbits sitting on the floor and not cuddling them.
Rabbits find being picked up and cuddled extremely stressful. You may well be scratched, kicked or bitten as they try to struggle free. This is not an aggressive behaviour, simply a way of escaping from a potential predator.
You may expect that the more you handle a rabbit as a kitten, the calmer they will become. Sadly, this often has a negative effect as the rabbit matures and often goes on to be a grumpy grown up.

 Let your rabbits come to you
The best way to socialise your rabbit is to sit on the ground in their run area offering tasty treats. This will help both you and your rabbits get the best out of living together. Avoid the temptation to stroke and pick them up. This way, your rabbits learn to hop up to you and away again without anything but pleasant things happening – this being food!
After a while, even the shyest rabbits will come up to inspect you. They will often rub their chin on your shoe or leg and hop over to nibble the treats on offer. This is their way of claiming you and feeling relaxed. If you’re able to do this with your rabbits daily, you’ll soon find they happily choose to hop and sit on your lap or follow you around.
Never offer your hand in front of your rabbits’ face to sniff. This will often result in a bite – it’s their blind spot and will take them by surprise.         "
How to tell if your cat is pregnant,"

Cat owners are encouraged to observe their pets and speak to Woodgreen about any noticeable changes that may indicate a forthcoming pregnancy if their female cats are not neutered.

How to tell if your cat is calling for a mate
If your cat isn’t neutered, there are a number of tell-tale signs that they are calling for a mate. Female cats will typically become very vocal, which can be confused with pain as it can be very loud. They will also start ‘presenting themselves’ and roll around on their back. Both male and female cats may also disappear for a few days at a time as they go in search of the opposite sex.

How to tell if your cat is pregnant
When a cat is pregnant, the early symptoms are very subtle. The first sign is ‘pinking up’, whereby their nipples become darker and potentially enlarged, alongside some behavioural changes. It’s likely that cats will have an increased appetite and be more emotionally needy than usual, although this does vary from cat to cat. Of course, their stomach will feel firmer and grow throughout pregnancy, which lasts around 63 days.

When introducing new hens to one another, make sure they’re all in good health and none have any injuries or wounds. Below are three different ways to mix chickens:

Evening mixing
Put all your chickens in the same coop at dusk so they go to sleep together. The idea is that in the morning they wake up as a group, as if they’ve always been living together. This also helps encourage a routine of going to bed together at night.
Split mixing
Allow your chickens to meet with a fence between them, so they become accustomed to each other without the risk of injury. After between 3 and 7 days, remove the fence and observe the chickens.
New territory mixing
If you’re lucky enough to have a spare chicken run, you can introduce your chickens in a neutral area that is new to all of them. This should reduce the amount of fighting as no chicken will feel the need to defend their territory.

Top tips for introducing chickens
A newly formed group of chickens may still start fighting, this is perfectly normal. Don’t separate hens unless there are injuries – unfortunately the squabbles need to take place to establish a pecking order. The following hints and tips will help stop the fights becoming serious:


 	Hang CDs around the chicken run. The reflections give your chickens something else to look at
 	Hang carrots, apples or melon in the chicken run. This gives your chickens something to eat and diverts their attention, often for very long time
 	Put multiple sources of food and water in the run. If higher ranking hens start guarding certain areas, each hen can still access food and water
 	Have some Sudocrem to hand. Chickens love the colour red so are attracted to blood. Cover any redness or minor wounds in Sudocrem to hide the colour.

Signs your hens accept each other:

 	Feeding close to each other
 	Practising natural behaviours such as scratching and dust bathing together
 	Content clucking to one another

Signs of aggression between hens:

 	Chasing each other
 	Loud squawking or screaming
 	Feather pecking
 	Jumping on one another
 	Flying at each other

Avoid areas that hens could get cornered or stuck in if they were being bullied. Nest boxes will need to be provided if the mix works, but take them out during mixing.

Cockerels can help your hens settle
To reduce aggressive behaviour between your hens, take out the bully hen or consider  introducing a cockerel. Cockerels should break up any bullying amongst hens, which helps to prevent injuries and wounds.
Cockerels make great pets, can be very gentle and, of course, are very handsome. They have a bit of a reputation for being noisy and aggressive, but this is not true for a lot of them. The hens will benefit from having a cockerel with them as they will hunt out food, such as worms and slugs, for the hens to eat, ward off predators and, if necessary, fight them to protect the hens.

 Introducing a cockerel to your hens
When choosing a cockerel, match their size to your hens. Large breed cockerels could harm small breed hens. It is also worth considering the mix of breeds you have in one area. Don’t keep small bantams with larger breeds as larger breeds often bully the smaller ones.
Don’t introduce a cockerel to ex-caged birds straight away. Ex-caged hens are often weak, and an over-enthusiastic cockerel could cause injuries.
You only need one cockerel for a flock of hens. They are very possessive of their girls and will fight aggressively to protect them. If you follow the rules above, a cockerel can be a great addition to your coop.

Signs your hens accept the cockerel

 	Hens and cockerel sitting together
 	Hens allowing the cockerel to mount
 	Eating and drinking together

Signs of aggression between cockerel and hens

 	Jumping on and mounting the hens continuously, causing the hens to scream
 	Chasing the hens
 	Pulling at the hens’ feathers
 	Holding onto the hens by the feathers
 	Charging at the hens with their spurs

How can I help my dog cope with people wearing masks and face-coverings?," 


Dogs are masters of body language. They have an uncanny ability to assess our emotional state by looking at both bodies and faces. They are used to seeing our lips move when we speak, our teeth when we smile, and how our face shape changes due to our breathing, etc.
When we wear masks, our dogs can no longer be sure of our or anybody else’s intentions, and this can cause real anxiety and a negative reaction in some dogs. On top of this, some of the masks that people are wearing are scary in their own right due to the chosen colour and design.

Building a positive association between your dog and masks
We need to do all we can to prepare our dogs for this new ‘normal’ and help them learn that masks or facial coverings are nothing to be afraid of.
You can start by just showing your dog a mask and then giving them a tasty treat. Once they are comfortable, lift the mask up to your face and again give your pooch a tasty treat.
Once your dog is comfortable with you wearing a variety of face coverings, he or she will be more prepared for seeing them when out and about. However, your training doesn’t stop there. For the next few weeks, give your dog a treat every time you pass someone who is wearing a mask. The aim of the training is to build a positive association between your dog and masks, so you can reduce or even eradicate any anxiety that seeing them might cause

Make your own: Rabbit forage weave," 

The weave is an ideal way to encourage natural browsing behaviour. It also encourages stretching and reaching which will help strengthen their backs, keeping them fit and healthy.

What you need:

 	A small amount of garden string or soft garden wire.
 	A bunch of safe wood twigs around 2ft in length, these can be apple, pear, willow, hazel or hawthorn
 	A large pile of fresh forage such as sticky weed, rose or wild dog rose, bramble, hazel and buddleia
 	Gardening gloves

How:
1. Lay one layer of 6 sticks out about 3-inches apart on the ground, then weave in and out of each stick a new stick. Repeat again, keeping them about 3-4 inches apart.
2. Use the string or soft wire to secure the ends. This should then provide you with a strong frame ready to weave the forage through.
3. As it is best to use long strips of forage, some plants may have thorns. This is ok for your pets, but it is advisable for you to wear gloves.
4. Once you have a thick layer of forage and very few gaps visible, your forage weave is ready to be given to your pets. It can be propped up against something or tied to the side of the enclosure.

Foraging for guinea pigs,"Although we’ve become used to the more commercial ways of buying pet food, we’re starting to consider the benefits of ‘growing your own’. Not only is gardening a natural way of relieving stress and anxiety for people, growing fresh food for your guinea pigs is healthier for them, better for the environment and your wallet!

How to get started
The best place to start is in your own garden, or if you don’t have access to your own green space, you could ask a friend or a family member if you can use a plot in theirs!

You will need: 

 	Gardening gloves
 	Secateurs
 	A wheel barrow, trug, or large bag
 	A mesh tray for drying out winter stock.

How to forage, and what plants are safe?
Luckily, the plants that are commonly found in most garden are safe for your small pets to eat. But if you’re not quite sure, we’ve compiled a list of pet-friendly plants for your guinea pig here.
Once you familiarise yourself with these pet-friendly plants, you can go out for a spot of wild foraging. Just make sure you’re in a public place or obtain permission if you find yourself on someone’s private land.
Make sure the natural forage your picking is free from chemical sprays, litter or other toxins such as dog urine. Try to avoid picking forage at your feet or the edges of growth by reaching a little bit higher.
When you familiarise yourself with the types of forage, you can mix them up and give them to your guinea pigs. Introducing them to new varieties a bit at a time will help their digestive systems adapt. It’s also worth noting that fresh forage is hard to come by in the winter, so you might want to try drying out the forage you’ve collected in mesh trays first and then transfer to boxes or paper bags ready for the winter. 
Growing your own
You can grow vegetables, herbs and flowers in your garden, allotment or even in pots on your balcony! What’s more, it’s a great activity for the whole family and teaches your children valuable life lessons. Pop into your local garden centre for some advice on how you can start. Don’t forget, gardening tools, seeds and pots can be picked up at most market stools or even charity shops!

Where can you buy forage?
If it’s not possible for you to grow your own forage, or you’d much prefer the convenience of buying it ready, there are a number of store-bought herbs and forage available. We recommend Burgess Snacks Country-Garden Herbs.

Have you got any questions?
If you have any questions about foraging for your guinea pigs, or looking for any advice about your pet in general, please don't hesitate to contact us. Our team are on hand to give you free advice and support.

Socialising kittens through appropriate play,"


All pets are a commitment, so it’s very important to think about the impact your home and family can have on their development.

While kittens still live with their mother, they learn lots of new things from her and eventually they begin to develop their own personalities. Their natural instincts will also kick in and they will start investigating and honing these skills.

We often see and hear the word ‘socialisation’ used when talking about cats, but what does this really mean? We’re going to explore the different factors.
Human socialisation
Human interaction is vital for a kitten’s development, it gets them used to being around and interacting with people, which helps them grow into a confident adult cat. This should be a gradual process and it’s important these interactions are introduced gently to ensure the kitten feels comfortable.

Kittens should have the choice of being fussed and spending time with their owners. Remember, not all interaction has to be hands on. Simply sitting and reading out loud to your kitten will help them get used to your voice. Using toys to interact with your kitten can also help you to build a stronger bond with them.

Playing is one of the main things you will see your kitten doing, it’s their way of entertaining themselves and it’s also a way for them to learn new things and practise their natural hunting   instincts.
Hunting instincts
Every cat has a desire to hunt, it’s one of their natural instincts. No cat is the same though, their natural drive to hunt will vary from cat to cat and some are better than others! All the playing and hunting you see from an adult cat has been practiced since they were kittens. Therefore, teaching appropriate play for a kitten is critical to prevent unwanted behaviours as they grow up.
Appropriate play
It’s tempting for everyone to play with their kitten, getting them to chase your hands or wiggling your feet under the duvet, but imagine this happening when the kitten has grown up. It’s going to hurt a lot more!

By playing with your kitten in this way and encouraging them to chase your movement, you are teaching them that it’s okay and they will be encouraged to continue behaving and playing in this way. If you then expect them to stop this behaviour as they grow up, you risk confusing your cat and this can be quite unfair.


  Toys
When playing with your kitten, remember the following stages of play: ‘stalk, chase, catch and kill’.

We recommend using feather and wand toys when playing with your kitten. You’ll be able to see their hunting instincts kick in. By wiggling a feather or wand, they’ll be able to catch the end and pounce on it. Make sure they miss it on occasion though, no cat would catch their prey perfectly every time!

Ever seen a kitten grab on to slippers or toys and hold them in their front paws, kicking at them with their back paws?

This is another crucial part of a kitten’s play session, this is where they get all their frustration and energy out.

Providing toys for them to do this will help your kitten feel satisfied and calm after a great playing session. This will enable them to exhibit their behaviours in a natural way and teaches them what’s appropriate play as they grow up.
Laser pointer pens
Many cats love chasing lights, pouncing and jumping on it, but because they’re unable to physically catch the light, this can leave them frustrated. For this reason, we suggest avoiding laser pointer pens when playing with your cat. Because of the frustration a cat may feel after a play session like this with a laser pen, this could cause behavioural problems for example, attacking owners for no obvious reason.

Using laser pointers can often promote light chasing in cats and although this doesn’t seem to be much of an issue during play sessions, other reflections of light cannot be avoided all the time. This in turn, encourages light chasing at inappropriate times, leaving destruction in their path.
Environment
Coming into a new environment can be pretty scary for kittens. There are lots of new things for them to experience, including unusual noises and smells that they may have never seen or heard before. Make sure you provide a safe and quiet area for your cat to relax, this will help them adapt to their new surroundings much quicker.

There is no right or wrong way for a kitten to react in these situations, some will be bold and want to know what's going on, so might explore their surroundings, while others might hide and take it slow.  Either way is ok and you should allow your kitten to do what’s right for them.

Leaving the radio on quietly will help your cat get used to voices and may come in a handy as a useful distraction from everyday noises in the home.
Other pets
Rehoming more than one kitten can seem like the best idea as they’ll have companionship and a play mate. Although this is true and as much as it’s a pleasure to watch them grow up together, when they reach maturity, this relationship can change. They may become distant and wish to have more space on their own away from each other. For this reason, we suggest allowing each cat to have their own supplies such as feeding stations, sleeping areas and toileting areas. They may still choose to use the same space, but providing multiple resources enables the cats to have choice and helps to reduce any competition or threat between them.

For any pre-existing animals in the home, we advise taking the introductions very slowly. It can be a daunting experience for both pets, so rushing this could easily cause stress. For more information on introducing your cat to an existing cat or pet in the home, please read our advice here:

Can rabbits live indoors?,"

Your rabbits will still need as much space indoors as they would outside. To achieve this, you'll need to convert a minimum of one standard-sized room  into their living quarters.

Things you'll need to consider with indoor rabbits

 	A baby gate or similar to keep them secure in the room but enable them to see what’s going on
 	Unless the floor is carpet, you should consider rugs or plenty of 'hop to' areas, as slippery flooring can cause muscle wastage or back damage
 	Your rabbits will need a room with natural sunlight and a steady, comfortable room temperature that will aid their natural twice-a-year moult
 	All electrical wires or plastic water pipes will need protecting from being chewed
 	All household plants will need to be removed
 	Provide lots of toys and activities, like dig trays, litter trays and items for them to hop on to and run through
 	Be prepared for chewing of furniture, faeces and urine stains on flooring.

Renting with pets,"

Start your house hunting early
It does take longer to find pet-friendly accommodation, so start your search early. Six-to-eight weeks before you need to move is a good time to begin. Being as flexible as you can might also increase your success. Try to consider as many homes as possible, and over as wide an area as you can.
Make a CV for your pet
Include as much information about your pet as you can. This can include things like the veterinary surgery they are registered at, their vaccination records, their flea and worming treatment dates, and if they are microchipped. If your pet is insured, be sure to include insurance company information. If it’s a dog and they have graduated at training classes, we also recommend including this.
Get a reference for your pet
A reference from your previous landlord can be very helpful. Knowing that a previous landlord was happy with your pet's behaviour in their property can go a long way in reassuring the new landlord that you and your pet will be good tenants.
Ask if pets are allowed, even if the advert says they aren't
Even if the property you are interested in says no pets, it's still worth asking the agent to call the landlord and enquire about your specific situation. Some landlords may be reluctant to allow particular pet types, but may be comfortable considering others. If you are able to visit the agents, have your pet's reference and CV prepared and ready to take along with you, as it could help open doors.


 Introduce your pet to your landlord
Inviting your landlord to your current home to meet your pet and see how they behave will reduce their concern. They will be relieved if your pet is settled, and there are not any signs of pet related damage.

Honesty is the best policy
We strongly advise not to keep a pet in a property without getting permissionDiscovering a tenant has a pet is likely to damage the trust between you and your landlord. This can cause serious consequences, and could lead to termination of your tenancy agreement.
Get written pet permission
If you have been given verbal permission to keep a pet at your property, always ask for that in writing. Also to prevent future problems, it is advisable to request and ensure that any ‘no pets’ clauses are removed before signing the tenancy agreement.         "
Should I adopt ex-caged hens?,"During this time, we have been able to collect thousands of hens direct from the farms and play host to BHW for monthly large rehoming days on our Godmanchester site.
On average, the group of British Hen Welfare and Woodgreen volunteers can return with 200-400 hens each time with others going off to other collection points around the region. Most will be rehomed on that day to homes already approved through BHW or ourselves.
Taking on ex-caged hens can be extremely rewarding, and they are well known for being the most confident of breeds. They are often keen to come and sit with the family in the home, or follow you around the garden. Because of this, it makes them ideal beginner hens, and they are also great for families with young children.
The hens initial condition really varies depending on the farm they have come from. All the hens we rescue are classed as ‘caged hens’ - this means they have never seen the sky, placed their feet on fresh grass, or had the opportunity to run, jump, explore, perch or sunbathe. These hens are used for producing large quantities of eggs and normally sent to slaughter at 18 months of age as this is when it is felt that the egg production levels drop. However, these beautiful and full of character hens can go on to lay for several more years, and certainly have lots of energy left to keep you busy whilst they explore their new world.

What to expect with ex-caged hens
Most hens will be missing some feathers - some more than others, and most will be slightly underweight.
When you get your ex-caged hens home, always allow them a few weeks to really settle into their surroundings. They will not be used to using enrichment or putting themselves to bed each night. Feeders may seem like completely baffling contraptions to them, and large open spaces will initially be quite daunting, so ensure you have the time to help them settle and learn how to really be chickens.
If you are interested in rehoming some ex-caged hens we often have plenty already available and waiting for new homes. Alternatively, you can contact The British Hen Welfare Trust to see when the next rescue date is planned in your area. 5 reasons why you should adopt some ex-caged hens:

 	
You will be offering these hens a second chance. The more people who adopt, the more we can save.



 	
It's an amazing opportunity for your family to really learn all about chickens, discover how wonderful they are, and gain a higher understanding of chicken welfare and the impact the food industry has on them.



 	
It's so rewarding to watch them develop into these healthy, confident chickens after receiving some much-deserved TLC.



 	
They are so much fun! They love to learn, explore and get up to mischief.



 	
They become part of the family. Lots of ex-caged hens really enjoy a cuddle, feeding from your hand or just following you round everywhere you go. Many are even partial to a snooze on the sofa if you let them.

Preventative healthcare for your dog,"





Although you can’t protect your dog from all diseases and illnesses, there are several preventative ways you can minimise the risk.

Vaccinating your dog
You can vaccinate your dog against distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, para-influenza and leptospirosis, many of which can be fatal if contracted and have no specific cure.  This is especially important as it’s estimated that more than half of all dogs in the UK are not vaccinated.
Your dog can start its vaccinations from eight weeks of age.  The primary vaccination course is carried out with two injections given three weeks apart. Your dog will also need an annual booster to keep immunity levels effective - if they miss this, they will need to be given the primary course again. All vaccinations should be carried out by a vet.

Flea treatments
Fleas are highly irritating and uncomfortable for dogs. To avoid getting an infestation you should use preventative flea treatment every 4-8 weeks. It’s important to use a veterinary product as these are much more powerful and effective than products sold in supermarkets. You can find these on the internet and in some pet shops in locked cabinets, as well as in vet practices.
If you have seen fleas it is important to treat your house as well as your dog. For every five fleas on your dog there will be another 95 living in your house. Fleas will only jump onto an animal to feed and lay eggs and will then live in the carpets, bedding etc.
You should vacuum all areas your dog is allowed in, including any chairs, sofas, rugs they sit on. Wash your dogs’ bedding along with your own follow this by using a household spray, paying particular attention to nooks and crannies.
Some dogs are also highly allergic to flea bites, known as Flea Allergy Dermatitis (FAD), leading to skin irritations, bald patches, scabby skin or spots. This often makes the dog lick or bite at themselves, causing infection and a trip to the vets.
A severe flea infestation can also cause anaemia in puppies, and the cat flea (the most common flea found on dogs) can also spread worms. Make sure you give your dog deworming medication if fleas have been seen.

Worming treatments
There are two types of worms that can affect a dog, the tapeworm and the roundworm.
Tapeworms are made up of segments and these will be passed out of a dog's bottom. The segments can move – you may see them wriggling in the fur around your dog’s back end, looking like small, white caterpillars. Roundworms don't have segments and can vary in size – from threadlike types which are barely visible through to the size of a common earthworm. They are often seen in a dog’s faeces.
Some dogs may show no signs of an infestation but for those who do, symptoms include: diarrhoea, anaemia, foul breath, loss of appetite, general loss of condition, failure to gain weight and in the case of lungworm, coughing. Puppies with worms often have a distended belly.
Puppies can be born with worms as they can be passed on from the mother if she is infected. The mother can be treated while she is pregnant and puppies should be given regular treatment from 8 weeks of age – see the individual product information for the correct dosage. Adult dogs should be treated approximately every six months with a veterinary product.






 Neutering your dog
As well as preventing unplanned pregnancies and unwanted litters, having your dog neutered has numerous health benefits. It can vastly reduce the risk of issues arising from aggression, roaming and hormonal problems.
The age that a dog can be neutered will vary between breeds but it’s a good idea to let your dog hit puberty first – and in the case of females, let them have their first season. If you’re unsure when you need to neuter your dog, visit our neutering page.

Insuring your dog
Vet fees can be very expensive, especially if your dog develops an on-going problem, needs long term medication or has a sudden accident. It doesn’t take long for the cost to mount up. Having pet insurance can ease the burden and give you peace of mind.
As with all insurance, premiums can vary significantly, as can what is covered. Make sure you shop around and read the small print carefully. For example, some companies will pay the vet directly but some will require you to pay them and will then reimburse you – this can be quite an expensive way of making a claim.
Most companies will not provide cover for any pre-existing conditions and there will be an excess to pay on claims you make. Each company will often have several levels of insurance, these will vary but the following is a rough guide:

12 month cover
This will cover your dog for an accident or illness for a 12 month period up to a set amount (e.g. £3,000) per condition. If you make a claim for a condition within this time you will no longer be able to make a further claim for the same condition once the 12 months has expired. This type of policy is useful if you own an older dog or one with several pre-existing conditions that would not covered anyway. Also if you can’t afford a higher premium, some cover is better than none
Lifetime cover
This will provide cover for on-going illnesses throughout your dog’s life, provided you don’t take a break in your cover, up to a set amount each policy year (e.g. £4000-£7000). Often third party liability insurance will be included here. This type of policy means you can claim for the same problem more than once
Top lifetime cover
Some companies offer a ‘premium’ lifetime cover that offers the same benefits as the standard cover but with a higher claim amount (e.g. up to £14,000)
Third party insurance
Some companies offer stand-alone third party insurance, which covers veterinary costs and legal cover if your dog causes an accident or attacks another animal.         "
An introduction to degus,"They are not necessarily a first-time pet but can make a super addition to a family keen to take on something different and fun. They are cheeky and mischievous and love nothing more than a card box to chew on or some willow tree branches to run along and oversee their kingdom from. The facts below will help you decide if Degus are the right pet for you.

Fast facts:
Companionship for degus
Degus really do prefer the company of their own kind and are most happy living in small same sex pairs or small groups.

Life expectancy for degus 
Degus can live up to 5-8 years

Accomodation for degus
Degus can be very active and enjoy exploring their surroundings. They are able to gnaw through plastic very easily so choosing a large metal cage with a metal floor is recommended. The ideal size cage for a pair to a small group of degus is:  159cm high, 93cm wide and 63cm deep.

Food for degus
Degus are herbivores, they require ample good quality hay, pellets and natural treats such as dried herbs and flowers.

Degus health
Degus are generally quite healthy animals; however, they can occasionally suffer from diabetes due to incorrect diet and tail injuries due to incorrect handling. It is important to choose a small pet friendly vet to ensure your degus receive the best possible care.

Are degus family friendly?
Some Degus really enjoy human interaction; they will take food from your hands and climb over you during free-range play time. However not all degus enjoy this, and many can find sudden loud noises etc frightening. Because of this they often suit families with slightly older children who are happy to take their time building up a relationship with their new pet degus.          "

How to introduce a new dog to your cat,"What to consider when matching dogs and cats:

 	Wherever possible, we suggest you choose a dog that has previously lived happily with cats.
 	Is your cat used to living with dogs, or has it met them before?
 	Is your cat elderly or physically compromised? It may be more difficult for an elderly or physically compromised cat to avoid unwanted interaction with a dog.
 	Will the cat have the ability to get away if the dog does decide to chase them?
 	Can you provide the cat with a retreat or ‘safe area’ where the dog cannot reach him, e.g. upstairs or in a bedroom? This safe area must have all of your new cat's important resources in it - such as food, water, litter trays, scratching posts, beds, toys, etc. This is essential until they are relaxed and happy with each other.
 	Can your cat get into the garden without having to pass the dog?
  
How to introduce a new dog to your cat
Gradually, as your cat becomes more used to the dog, you can allow more interaction. Keep the dog on the lead and let them approach your cat for a sniff and then call them away. Give the dog a tasty treat every time he looks away from your cat and towards you. A slow, careful introduction will ensure the safety of both animals, especially your cat – who may not take kindly to this strange smelling, looking and sounding animal being brought into their territory. This will also help to establish a long lasting relationship.

Make sure you don’t force the animals together, for example by carrying your cat towards the dog. Not only will this terrify your cat, but you could be bitten or scratched by them as they struggle to get away. Instead, let them investigate each other in their own time.
Preparing for the introduction
Before you bring the dog home, move your cat’s litter tray, food, water, beds, scratching post and toys to a location where the dog won’t have access. Where possible this should include a route in and out without passing the dog. Baby gates are really helpful for when your cat becomes confident enough to enter the dog’s space and will be able to retreat to their own safe area again without the dog being able to follow. You can buy baby gates with cat flaps in them to make it easier for your cat, especially if the cat is elderly or compromised in some way and can't jump over a baby gate easily.

Introductions with dogs are best done indoors. The dog should always be on a secure lead whenever your cat is present until you’re sure that they are comfortable together. Make sure you actively reward the dog for not chasing or being overly bold towards your cat. You may also want to walk the dog beforehand so he is more relaxed and calm.
Using food in the introduction
Use food to get the dog and your cat used to each other. Place a tasty treat in reach of your cat but out of the dog’s reach. At the same time, give the dog a stuffed Kong or chew. Eating is a pleasurable experience and so the association between the other animal and food may help smooth any relationship problems.
When can I let them live together normally?
Gradually, as your cat becomes more used to the dog, you can allow more interaction. Keep the dog on the lead and let your cat approach the dog to investigate if it wants to. Give the dog a tasty treat every time they look away from your cat and towards you.

Try to ensure that the dog is never allowed to chase your cat. Dogs can find this very exciting and it can be difficult to stop once this behaviour has started. Reward the dog for ignoring or turning away from your cat.

After a couple of weeks you’ll have a good idea if it’s safe to let the dog off the lead when your cat is present. If your cat is very shy or timid around the dog, it may take longer. Try to be patient and do things slowly and with care. Even the most dog-friendly cats can sometimes take time to accept a new dog’s arrival.

What to feed your cat,"

There are so many diets available it can be confusing to pick one, and have confidence you’re doing your best by your cat.

Be careful changing their food
When you first get a new cat you should always try to keep them on the diet they’re used to. If you decide to change your cat’s diet for any reason then this should always be modified gradually, by adding a little more new food each day and decreasing the one that is being replaced. If your cat suffers from a sensitive stomach or regular episodes of vomiting then consult a vet for advice on feeding.

Think about their stage of life
You should always try to keep your cat on a good quality, life stage diet. There are a range of dry and wet diets available, made by hundreds of different manufacturers.
Kittens should be fed three to four small meals throughout the day. Kitten food is available to buy in dry and wet versions, it will give all the extra nutrients for growth that are required. The biggest range of cat food is aimed at the fully grown adult cat. They come in all different varieties and should provide a balanced diet to maintain good health. Older cats should ideally be fed on a senior diet which contains extra nutrients for an ageing cat.

Specially tailored diets
Some larger cat food manufacturers produce a wide range of diets, so you can be more specific than just the age. You can get food for particular breeds of cats, indoor cats, neutered cats and dental or hairball diets. It’s your choice whether you want to feed your cat a specially tailored diet and whether to pick a wet food, dry food or mixture of both. As long as the diet provides complete nourishment for your cat, then let them decide what they like best.

Wet food
Wet food should always be stored appropriately and replaced regularly, especially in hot weather. Some wet foods are advised by a vet for particular medical conditions, such as kidney disease or urinary problems. Only use these or change to a different diet at the request of your vet.

Dry food and biscuits
Biscuits provide a good opportunity to keep your cat’s teeth clean as they help chip the tartar and plaque off their teeth. Even still, it’s quite normal for your cat to require dental work by a vet at various points in its life, usually the latter years. If your cat has a sore mouth or is lacking in teeth then be careful when giving them a dry diet.

Foods to avoid
Many cats are lactose intolerant, so avoid giving them cow’s milk and provide fresh water at all times. Human food – including cheese, chocolate or eggs – should be avoided as treats, unless it is steamed white fish or chicken. Cat treats should be given in moderation or as a reward for positive behaviour.
Please also be aware that cats will eat grass and it does often make them sick, but this isn’t damaging to them and is a natural thing for them to do. You can purchase cat grass, but this will do exactly the same thing as them going outside and eating grass.


 Hypoallergenic diets
There are now many hypoallergenic diets available to cat owners. This means they don’t contain ingredients that cats are commonly allergic to, or struggle to digest. It is advisable to go for a hypoallergenic diet if you can afford to do so.

Beware of owner appeal
Many cat foods are designed by companies to appeal to humans. They will often place vegetables in them, make them multi coloured or design them to look like our food. In reality this is done to attract us, rather than the need for the cat to have vegetables or fruit in its diet. Try to avoid products with unnecessary ingredients or lots of brightly coloured biscuits.

Avoid overfeeding your cat
Overfeeding cats is a very common problem, it causes obesity and it can have many related medical issues. If your cat is gaining or losing weight then please consult a vet for advice regarding diet.

Multi-cat feeding
If you have more than one cat, always feed them separately – even if they’re content eating together. This means each cat gets its time to eat in peace and you can also monitor who is eating what. Try to get a low sided bowl so your cat can eat comfortably, pressure on the whiskers can be an unpleasant sensation for a cat.

Make feeding time more stimulating
In the wild cats spend a large proportion of their time stalking, catching and eating their prey. In contrast, most domestic cats take two minutes to eat their food. You can make feeding more stimulating for your cat by doing the following:


 	Scatter feed the dry biscuits around the feeding area
 	Hide the food around in the house so your cat has to find each bit
 	Create forage boxes with shredded paper and dry food inside
 	Some cats enjoy retrieving food that an owner has thrown for the cat
 	Most pet shops sell feeder panels or treat balls that the cat has to manipulate in order to receive the food
 	Rubber Kongs can also be brought from pet shops which can have wet food placed inside
 	You could always make your own feeding toys – one of the most common is a triangle shape of toilet rolls stuck to a base, so your cat has to pull each individual treat out with their paw.

How to groom your cat," 


Getting involved with grooming is essential if your cat is long haired; it doesn't need to be a traumatic experience and can often be a positive experience for both of you.

If you introduce grooming at an early age, most cats will learn to enjoy it and actively seek the brush in later years.
Why groom your cat

 	Grooming will help prevent hairballs, formed when your cat swallows dead hair during self-grooming
 	Grooming with a brush helps stimulate the circulation and enhance their muscle tone
 	Grooming helps spread natural oils, which the cat produces to waterproof the coat
 	Grooming means you won’t have to get your cat dematted under anaesthetic
 	Grooming your cat can also help improve the bond between you
 	Grooming gives you a great opportunity to health check your cat for lumps on a regular basis
 	Groom your cat more in summer to help them keep cool.

What type of grooming does your cat need?

 	Short haired cats require small amounts of grooming. Lightly groom them on a regular basis using a bristle brush or a short-toothed comb. They will generally find it easy to keep their coat clean, unless their coat is particularly dense.
 	Semi haired cats require grooming a few times a week to prevent knots and matts developing. Use a metal comb that has alternate long and short teeth – the long teeth reach down to the base of the coat and the short teeth will pick up any excess hair on the surface. Follow this grooming with a soft brush to add shine and condition to the coat.
 	Long haired cats require daily grooming to keep their coat in top condition. Again, use a metal comb with alternate long and short teeth. Long haired cats need grooming all over, they can become especially knotted around the bottom, legs and stomach.


 
The grooming process

 	Make sure your cat is on a stable surface, such as the sofa or the floor. Spend a little time making your cat comfortable by stroking or giving treats. Make sure you are in a relaxed state and happy to groom them. If you’re feeling nervous about how your cat will react they can often sense this
 	Show your cat a soft bristled brush, allow the cat to smell the brush and face rub if they want to. Begin by brushing the cat’s head, going in the direction of the cat’s fur, but avoiding the whiskers. If the cat enjoys this then progress to the shoulders
 	Speak quietly and gently to the cat, this will help reassure them throughout grooming
 	Your initial grooming sessions should last no longer than a few minutes. Gradually increase this over time but never for longer than 15 minutes
 	Reward your cat throughout by using small treats or titbits. This way the cat associates grooming with a positive experience, such as being fed or getting attention
 	Many cats are sensitive to having their back or bottom brushed, always take care when grooming this area. Try to monitor their body language throughout grooming, if you sense your cat isn’t happy then stop
 	Once your cat is familiar with the soft brush, you can start to use a metal brush during the grooming. Each brush will need introducing to the cat as they will all feel different
 	If you find a small area of fur that is already knotted, try teasing the knot with your fingers or cutting the knot away. It can be very unpleasant for your cat to have these groomed out
 	Start grooming on a positive note – if your cat is already severely matted then it can be difficult to make this a good experience. Contact your local vet about getting your cat dematted, you can then start the grooming process in a positive way.

When to stop grooming your cat
During grooming always keep a close eye on your cat’s body language to check if they’re comfortable with grooming. Body language to look out for is tail twitching and fidgety behaviour, this generally means they are impatient and have a desire to escape. Many cats will growl or grumble, telling you that their patience is wearing thin.

Take care when grooming, if you don't see the warning signs you may end up being bitten or scratched. Always stop grooming if you think your cat is unhappy. It’s better to do short enjoyable sessions, rather than one that is really long and upsetting for your cat.
On-going grooming care
It’s really important that once you start grooming your cat, and put effort into making it a positive experience, that you keep it up. Factor grooming into your daily routine, such as when the family sit down to watch television in the evenings. This will make it less of a chore, and more enjoyable for your cat and for you!

Guinea pigs and Covid-19,"Can my guinea pigs pass on coronavirus?
It's unlikely that your guinea pigs will catch coronavirus. But if they do, generally their symptoms will be mild, and they'll be better in a few days. There is no evidence to suggest that humans can catch Covid-19 from small pets including guinea pigs, and you cannot infect them with it either.

Taking care of your guinea pigs
If you own guinea pigs and you’re concerned about not being able to pick up their usual food and vegetables from the shop due to reduced stock, you can forage for plants yourself: here's a list of what you can forage for.

Other things to consider

 	Stock up on food and medication for your guinea pigs, in case you have to self-isolate and can’t leave the house for a while.
 	When your cleaning out your guinea pig’s accommodation, make sure you keep the area you’re in well ventilated and wear a mask to make sure dusty bedding doesn’t aggravate any symptoms you might be experiencing.
 	Make yourself aware of your veterinary practice's availability, so you can be prepared if you need to visit them. Join their Facebook page, or check their website for the most up-to-date advice.
 	Always wash your hands after handling your guinea pigs!

How to safely handle your guinea pigs,"Most guinea pigs will try to wriggle free or run away when you want to pick them up – this is completely natural. Even though you can socialise with them, feed them from your hand and have them sit on your lap, they’ll always remain slightly wary of humans. You’re still a potential ‘predator’ in their eyes.

When choosing your guinea pigs, you might want to consider going for a pair of mature adults that are used to being handled. Babies and young guinea pigs can be extremely fast and easy to squeeze or drop, whereas a mature adult will sit happily on your lap munching some treats.

Allowing children to care for and bond with their pets can be an exciting and enjoyable experience. You should supervise them at all times to prevent the guinea pigs from being squeezed or dropped. Never allow a child to carry or walk around with your guinea pig in their arms. Instead, encourage them to sit on the floor with a blanket on their lap for the guinea pig to sit on. This way, if your guinea pig moves, there’s no risk of a fall injury.

Watch our video below to find out the best way for children to interact with guinea pigs.  On the move with your guinea pigs 
It’s important that you always have a suitable pet carrier available, just in case you need to rush your guinea pigs to the vet. They’re also handy for when you’re cleaning out their enclosure. Cardboard boxes should be avoided as these can quickly and easily be nibbled through, leading to escapees.

Hard plastic cat carriers are perfect for your guinea pigs to use. To keep your guinea pigs relaxed and happy, place some newspaper or a fleecy blanket in the base of the carrier, along with lots of hay for them to eat and hide in.

Foraging for rabbits,"

Growing your own food and forage for pets is slowly becoming a lost skill, as we’ve been introduced to more commercial methods. However, pet owners are again starting to take a keen interest in gardening, going out in the fresh air, and providing a healthier diet for their pet rabbits.
There are many benefits to growing and foraging for your rabbits. These include huge financial savings, reduced plastic waste and a healthier diet for your pets. It's also a great way to practise mindfulness yourself.

What you will need for foraging
If you are new to foraging, we recommend you buy 'Foraging for Rabbits' by Twigs Way, available on the RWAF website. It's a very useful guide to help you identify suitable safe plants and avoid dangerous ones.

You will also need: 

 	Gardening gloves
 	Secateurs
 	A wheel barrow, trug, or large bag
 	A mesh tray for drying out winter stock.

How to forage for rabbits, and what plants are safe
The most obvious place to start foraging is in your own garden, or your friends and family’s gardens. Many of the most common plants found in gardens are safe for your pets to eat. Here's a list of safe plants for your rabbits.
Once you feel confident enough about spotting wild forage, you can take a bag with you when out in public areas, etc. It is always best to obtain permission to forage on someone's land, if possible.
When picking, always ensure the forage is free from chemical sprays, litter and dog urine by picking plants a little higher up or deeper into the plant growth.
Once you have collected some forage, you can give your pets daily mixed piles of food. You should always introduce new plants in small amounts, to allow their digestive systems to adapt. As much of the safe forage is a little harder to come by in winter, it is a good idea to dry some of the forage in advance. Put the forage in mesh trays, to allow the air to circulate and dry it correctly, without harbouring mould spores. You can then store the dried forage in cardboard boxes or paper bags to give to your rabbits during the winter.


 Growing your own rabbit forage
If you have access to a garden, allotment or balcony, growing your own vegetables, herbs and flowers is a great family activity. Your local garden centre can give you advice on the best way to start with the space you have.
Gardening doesn’t need to be expensive - you can pick up packets of seeds for under a pound. You'll find tools and pots etc. at most car boot sales, or local markets.

Buying rabbit forage from shops
If you don't have space to grow forage, or would rather not go exploring, you can buy ready-made herbs and forage. We recommend Burgess Snacks Country-Garden Herbs.

Neutering your rabbits: what you need to know,"

If you love rabbits, remember it’s best they live as a pair to keep them happy and healthy. The best mix is a male and female, but make sure they're neutered or you'll most likely end up with more than you expected! Male rabbits can be neutered from 3-4 months of age or as soon as their testicles have appeared. Females can be neutered from 4-6 months, depending on their size. As with all procedures, neutering has risks, which you should discuss with your small pet-savvy vet.


Benefits of rabbit neutering

There are many benefits to neutering your pet rabbits. These include:


 	Helping prevent uterine cancer in females, which they are very prone to from the age of four years.
 	Reducing the early signs of fighting.
 	Stopping male rabbits spraying over their enclosure, their companion, and you.
 	A much higher success rate when bonding.
 	Stopping females from experiencing phantom pregnancies,  which can be stressful for them.
 	A much higher success rate when bonding, if you’re planning on introducing more than one pair of rabbits.
 	Preventing unexpected/unwanted babies.
 	Helps with litter training.


 
Before and after neutering care
Going into a vet practice can be very stressful for pet rabbits. To help reduce this, you can take some of their bedding with them that has their scent, which can then be placed in the hospital cage.
Rabbits must have plenty of hay and fresh food available pre and post op. Some small species need to be starved for a certain amount of time, whereas rabbits must continue to eat to maintain their gut movement.
Once your rabbits return to their enclosure, it can be a good idea to offer a soft, warm area for them to rest. Using some towels and even a snuggle-safe heat pad placed within their enclosure can be ideal.
For the next 48 hours it is very important to monitor their toileting output and food intake, and you should also monitor their neuter site for any signs of infection, etc.

Managing obesity in rabbits,"


Unfortunately, obesity in rabbits doesn’t just mean they have a few extra curves. They are at greater risk of being exposed to fly strike, excessive amounts of grape-like smelly poo which is visible daily. They can suffer joint mobility issues, matted fur, and even gut blockages. Thankfully, there are plenty of things you can do to help get your rabbits back to their happy, binky-loving self.

Provide a spacious environment
Rabbits need a large spacious environment 24/7 to help keep them fit and active. If your rabbits are currently spending many hours in an indoor cage or hutch, it's time to look at adding more space. However, you should do this slowly and cautiously, especially if the rabbits have been housed in a smaller space for some time, so they can adjust to the extra space. Slowly over a few weeks, increase the space. You can do this in by following either of these two suggestions:


 	
Set them up in a new enclosure, but do not give the whole space to them all at once. Slowly allow them more and more of it, plus add in new enrichment items gradually each time

 	
Slowly extend what you have already been using by adding attachments from companies such as www.runaround.co.uk. After a few weeks, your rabbits will have been able to safely adapt to extra space and have the ability to hop further, reach up, dig, and even run.


Find out more about suitable rabbit accommodation in our advice article.

Maintain a healthy diet
Rabbits need a healthy diet made up of 85% hay/grass, 10% fresh forage and 5% nuggets, plus constant access to a fresh water supply. Read our article for more information on what should be included in your rabbit's diet.
If you have noticed any of the above health concerns with your rabbit, making slow but key changes to your rabbits daily diet can make a big difference. Firstly, ensuring your rabbits are eating plenty of hay is very important. Rabbits like to browse, so dotting large fluffy piles about, or garden hanging baskets filled with hay can help. Even replacing litter in the trays with newspaper and lots of meadow hay will encourage them to eat more.



  
Switching up their diet
If you have a fussy hay eater, try mixing up hay types and sprinkling some dry forage in it for extra interest and taste. One of the biggest culprits of obesity in rabbits tends to be giving them far too much dry-feed. Whether this is nuggets or muesli, make sure you're not giving them too large a bowl. It's very important to move your rabbits off muesli-type dry feeds, as these are often high in sugar and can contribute to dental disease. If your rabbits are used to this, you will need to slowly wean them onto a nugget dry-feed, such as Burgess Mature or Adult Nuggets, over a period of 2-3 weeks to ensure their digestive system safely adapts to the change.
We recommend each rabbit has no more than what would fit into a feed ball once a day. Feed balls are also a great way to get your rabbits moving, and help you to not give them too much. You can buy feed balls from most pet shops or Amazon.
It's really important to provide fresh food as close to rabbits' natural wild diet as possible. This will help reduce obesity and aid healthy digestion.

Feeding forage
Foods such as carrots, various fruits and vegetables are not part of a natural diet. They are often too fattening, and can lead to other health complications. Try going back to basics and slowly swapping these unhealthy foods for plants such as bramble, strawberry, or raspberry leaf. Handfuls of fresh picked grass, wild geranium, safe woods such as hazel/willow/apple/hawthorn, are all great for their teeth and digestive system. Find out more about foraging for your rabbits in our article.

How to spot bumblefoot in chickens,"There are usually two causes of bumblefoot.
The first is a foot wound which allows bacteria to get in. The wound then closes over with the bacteria trapped in the foot. A large hard swelling can then develop at the base of the foot.
The other common cause is the foot being continuously exposed to moist bedding or ground. This damages the foot pads and again allows entry of bacteria.

What are the signs of bumblefoot?
The first sign your chicken may be suffering from a problem is often if they’re walking slightly oddly or obviously lame. Sometimes there is no obvious abnormality on the leg or foot, other times you’ll see a round lesion on the base of the foot.
Your chicken’s foot may or may not be inflamed and hot to the touch compared to other scaled areas. How is bumblefoot treated?
Wash the infected foot daily with antiseptic solution – remember to dry it thoroughly afterwards. Wrap a soft bandage around the foot with a waterproof covering, and change daily.
If after 5 days the infection hasn’t cleared up, talk to your vet. They’ll likely prescribe your chicken with a course of antibiotics. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before starting any treatment.

How do I avoid bumblefoot reoccurring?
Reduce the amount of wet litter in your chicken run and make sure you don’t allow a build-up of mud that the birds will stand in for long periods of time. Chickens who spend too much time in wet muddy conditions are more prone to bumblefoot.

If you’re thinking of adopting a chicken with bumblefoot
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new bird and ask for more details on how the condition has been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any chicken who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.         "
An introduction to chinchillas,"
They are beautiful creatures known for their amazing fur and big, saucer ears. Chinchillas can become very tame if they are socialised well. However, they are crepuscular, which means they are more active at dusk and dawn so their activity patterns may not suit all families. If you are thinking about adopting some chinchillas the facts below will help make the decision a little easier.

Fast facts: 
Companionship for chinchillas
Chinchillas really do prefer the company of their own kind and are most happy living in small same sex pairs, small groups or a castrated male to one or more females.

Life expectancy for chinchillas
Chinchillas can live up to 12-20 years

Accommodation for chinchillas
Chinchillas can be very active and enjoy exploring their surroundings. They are able to gnaw through plastic very easily so choosing a large metal cage with a metal floor is recommended. The ideal size cage for a pair to a small group of Chinchillas is:  159cm high, 93cm wide and 63cm deep. Chinchillas also need to be kept in a cool room away from direct sunlight.

Food for chinchillas
Chinchillas are herbivores, they require ample good quality hay, pellets and natural treats such as dried herbs and flowers.

Chinchilla health
As chinchillas can live up to 20 years there will be times, they may need to see the vet, it is recommended to find a vet who has specialised in chinchillas for the best possible care. Chinchillas can be prone to dental disease often due to an incorrect diet.

Are chinchillas family-friendly? 
Some Chinchillas really enjoy human interaction; they will take food from your hands and hop over you during free-range play time. However not all chinchillas enjoy this, and many can find sudden loud noises etc frightening. Because of this they often suit families with slightly older children who are happy to take their time building up a relationship with their new chinchillas.

How to make your chickens feel at home,"
Make your chickens feel at home

 	Keep your chickens in social groups. They love the company of other hens and a cockerel, making them feel happy and safe
 	Provide perches and nest boxes in their run or free-range area as well as their coop – hens lay eggs throughout the day and will often perch to sleep in the sunshine
 	Dust or soil baths are a natural way for your chickens to clean themselves – simply fill a cat litter tray with organic compost, soil or mud. If you have a large number of chickens, make sure you provide several trays as they may fight over them. You can also add mite and lice treatment to your chickens’ dust bath
 	Hanging treats, such as cabbages, carrots or corn on the cob, are great stimulation for your chickens – and also very tasty
 	Large logs or tree stumps provide a great perch, something to climb over and a great habitat for tasty bugs. Your chickens will spend their time scratching and pecking at the wood until they reach their reward
 	Secured bookcases or shelves of varying levels will intrigue your chickens, and many of them like to fly up and sit high up in their area. Exercise will help to build up the strength of any ex-caged hens.

Caring for activities and toys

 	Vary the position, amount and different activities you use to keep them exciting and stimulating for your chickens.
 	Remember to clean and disinfect anything your chickens use once a week to reduce any mess building up.
 	Remember to provide enough so that all your chickens will have the chance to enjoy a variety of activities, which will reduce the risk of arguments.

Your chickens' health: what to look out for," 

They will be eating and drinking as normal and be enthusiastic about treats. Their wattles and combs will be bright red in colour, and the comb should be upright. Give your chickens a health check at least once a month.

A poorly chicken will appear slumped or hunched over and may have their eyes shut. Their combs and wattles can look much paler in colour and be flopped to one side. If you’re unsure about your chickens’ health, consult your vet.
Your chickens’ life expectancy
Ex-commercial hens will generally live between 2 and 6 years. Other breeds can live 8-10 years, and can occasionally survive into their teens.
Clip your chickens’ wings
This will prevent them from escaping, which could put them in danger and at risk from predators. Clip both wings as your chickens can still attempt to fly with only one wing clipped, which could get them into tricky situations. When wing clipping, the aim is to cut the main flight feathers. Always leave your chickens with two feathers for preening. The diagram opposite shows how to wing clip with clean, sharp scissors.
Look out for sour crop
This is when feed in your chicken’s food pipe or crop hasn’t digested properly and starts to ferment. This makes their crop much larger. It’s a serious condition and can be fatal if left untreated.

If your chicken has sour crop, try tipping them forwards – this often makes them sick which helps clear the blockage. Also try giving them probiotic yoghurt (they tend to love strawberry) and gently massaging them to help move the stodgy build-up from the crop. Your chicken will often be off their food, so you’ll need to monitor their eating and make sure they’re still consuming food.
Treat chickens for lice
Prevent lice by treating your chicken routinely with power. Apply the powder under each wing and between the shoulders on the back. Lice are often visible and can be seen by parting the feathers on your chicken’s back to show the skin.

If your chickens have a bad case of lice, you will see them crawling all over in their hundreds, and their feathers will be dirty and unkempt. Mild cases are still visible and need to be treated in the same way. You should wear gloves when handling chickens with lice.

 
What to do about scaly leg in chickens
Scaly leg is when mites infest your chickens’ legs, burying beneath the scales so they lift and appear uneven. Smother your chickens’ legs in Vaseline to suffocate the mites. In extreme cases, their legs will need cleaning with surgical spirit for a few days until the old scales fall off and new ones can grow through.

Scaly leg is contagious and can be passed from bird to bird, so it’s best to treat all birds kept in the same area. Scaly leg spray can be applied during your routine health checks to prevent the condition.
Worm your chickens
Worm your chickens once every three months. This will prevent worms as well as treat them, if needed. Flubenvet is a powder-based wormer that can be mixed with your chickens’ normal pellets and corn mix – feed them this consecutively for seven days. You can still eat your chickens’ eggs when they’re on Flubenvet.
What to do if your chicken is egg bound
A chicken is egg bound when one of their eggs gets stuck during laying. Their rear will become enlarged, and there may be discharge. This can be fatal if not treated, and you should contact your vet immediately if you suspect it. Becoming egg bound is more common in elderly birds.

Your chicken will need treating with pain relief and antibiotics. Be aware that some antibiotics mean you won’t be able to eat the eggs from that hen again.
Respiratory issues in chickens
Chickens can sometimes suffer with respiratory issues, where they will sound raspier when breathing and sometimes get a build-up of bubbles around their eyes and nostrils. This will need veterinary attention, they are likely to prescribe antibiotics.

Keep your chickens’ night time accommodation clean and free from ammonia or mess, and make sure they’re kept warm. A fresh air flow will help keep your coop dry and help prevent respiratory issues from developing.
If your hens get broody
Broody hens sit on their eggs to try to hatch them. It’s common, but it can be very dangerous to their health. You will need to remove the eggs as broody hens will sit on them for days at a time and not leave for food or water.

You should also reduce the amount of nest boxes available and encourage your chicken to be out of the coop and active, or you will find they become weak very quickly. ‘Keep well’ pellets can be added to their feed to help maintain your chickens’ general health.
Preventing red mites in chickens
Red mites are a very common blood sucking bug, which will appear at night to feed off your hens’ blood. They’re the size of a pin prick. Low numbers will cause irritation, but large numbers can lead to anaemia in your chickens. Add Diatomaeceous Earth, available from pet shops, to their nest boxes and dust baths to help prevent an infestation.

Poisonous food and plants for rabbits,"


Rabbits also reach for forage along native hedgerows. Forage is a great way of providing a healthy diet for your rabbit. It’s also a great way of practising mindfulness for yourself. To help your rabbits live a long and healthy life, their diet should be as natural and varied as possible. You should also make sure you know which poisonous food and plants to avoid.

Rabbit foods to watch out for

 	Lettuce and many fruits are the most common cause for loose faeces in rabbits - and have limited nutritional value.
 	Carrots are ok in small amounts, but are extremely fattening.
 	Pet shop treats such as yoghurt drops, chew bars etc are very fattening and can contribute to poor dental health.
 	Avocado
 	Potatoes

It’s important to note that you should avoid all muesli-style feeds, because it’s been proven they’re one of the most common causes of fatal dental and digestive disease. Watch out for all those colourful treats you see in pet shops, as well as sticky honey based treats, salt licks and mineral blocks. These can all be harmful to your rabbit, and there’s lots of quality food you can feed your rabbit, ensuring they have a good, natural diet.



 
Plants to watch out for

 	Ragwort
 	Ivy
 	Privet
 	Holly
 	Yew
 	Hemlock
 	Wild garlic
 	Lords and ladies – common in damp or woody areas.
 	Any plants with bulbs
 	Buttercup leaves and flowers can cause extreme discomfort and in some cases be fatal
 	Foxglove
 	Nightshade
 	House plants such as the spider and rubber plant

Remember: if you go out foraging, take a plant ID or forage book with you so you don’t pick dangerous plants

How many degus should you keep?,"
In the wild, they live in communal groups, working together to protect their territory from other communities. They enjoy feeding and grooming together – and also use one another for security by making vocal ‘alert’ sounds and body movements.
Ideally, degus should be housed in same-sex pairs, or a castrated male can live with one or more females. Introducing degus to a new companion is possible but must be done with great care and patience. They can be extremely territorial and aggressive if it’s not done correctly.

Introducing your degus to each other
When introducing degus, use the split mix or side-by-side method. This involves having their cages side-by-side for a week or two to allow them to get used to the possibility of living together.
If your degus show aggression through the bars at each other, you will need to make the distance between the cages slightly bigger – and then, slowly bring them closer together again.
Once they are quite content with the arrangement, allow them to have some free-range time together in a secure, degu-friendly room. Place healthy treats, food, boxes and items for them to investigate around the room.
You may need to carry this out for 10-15 minutes daily for a week or so until they seem content with each other and you are observing friendly behavioural signs.

Signs your degus accept each other

 	Groom themselves or each other
 	Eating contently alone or with the new companion
 	Sitting next to each other
 	Following each other in a calm, relaxed manner whilst exploring.

If you see these signs, place your degus together in a clean, neutral cage. Ideally, do this in the morning after an exploring session, as they are more likely to settle down and sleep than squabble.

Signs your degus may not be suited

 	Teeth chattering towards each other
 	Constant vocal grumbles and squeals towards each other
 	Actively seeking the other out and starting a fight
 	Rearing up at each other, mouths open
 	Full fight or fur flying
 	Any injury or blood – ideally split them up before this is allowed to happen. Any injuries, no matter how minor, should be monitored by a vet to avoid infection.

Follow all the steps listed above and there’s an excellent chance your degus will bond and become lifelong friends. Good luck.

Neutering your ferrets: what you need to know,"

Ferrets can be kept in same-sex pairs or a male and female. Whichever pairing you go for, it’s best to get them all neutered to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Male ferrets can be neutered from 5-6 months of age, while females are best to be neutered at around 7-8 months, but your vet will guide you on each female.
There are many benefits to neutering your pet ferrets. Some of these include:


 	Prevents unexpected/unwanted babies
 	Reduces odour
 	Aids mixing as entire ferrets are more likely to be tricky to mix
 	Prevents the risk of females developing Pyometra


Before and after care for your ferrets
Some small animal species need to be starved for a certain amount of time before an operation, this is the case for ferrets between 1-4 hours. Your vet will advise you on their preference.
Once you return your ferrets home, ensure they have plenty of cosy blankets to snuggle in, and monitor the wound for any signs of infection.

What to do if your dog eats poo,"









Eating their own poo, or other dogs’ for that matter is right at the top of the list. You may feel your dog is the only one that does it but it’s a lot more common than you’d think.
Why do dogs eat poo?
There are many reasons for dogs eating poo. It could be a dietary problem, it could have a medical cause, and sometimes there’s a behavioural reason. It’s really important to look into the cause as this will help find a solution.
Diet and health reasons for dogs to eat poo

 	Make sure your dog is on the right diet for their life stage. Dogs who aren't getting the right nutrients often eat other dog’s poo, as it may contain the nutrients they’re lacking
 	Make sure your dog’s parasite control us up to date
 	Many medical conditions cause dogs to eat poo. For example they could have an enzyme deficiency. This means they’re unable to absorb the nutrients from their food, so they pass the undigested nutrients in their poo and consume it again
 	See your vet if your dog eats poo - don’t worry about asking them, they’ll have been asked many times before. Keep a record of when and how often it’s happening and if it’s just your dog’s own poo, or the poo of other dogs
 	Dogs who eat poo due to a medical cause often look perfectly fit and healthy so it’s important to check it out even if they’re in tip top condition.









 
Behavioural reasons for dogs to eat poo

 	Dogs who have experienced punishment, especially during their housetraining can learn to eat their own poo, heartbreakingly this is possibly to hide the evidence. During housetraining always ignore when your dog does it in the wrong place and praise when they go where you want them to
 	Like toddlers, puppies are curious and often everything new they experience ends up in their mouths. Picking up in the garden and being around your puppy most of the time to clear up after an accident is usually enough to prevent this becoming a long term issue
 	Dogs who spend lots of time on their own become bored and this can increase the risk of poo eating becoming a habit. Ensure your dog is happy and content and making feeding more interesting will help solve this
 	Occasionally a dog learns to get a reaction by eating poo, this is attention-seeking behaviour. Don’t get angry or chase them away from it as this is the attention they crave.If your dog does this, wait until they’re finished then call them and reward them for coming. Teaching them an alternative rewarding behaviour normally stops attention-seeking poo eating. Training your dog to leave on command really helps here
 	Female dogs and occasionally males in the home clean up after young puppies, this is normal instinctive behaviour to keep the nest and puppies clean. Ignore this behaviour and once the puppies are weaned it should stop on its own.

How to stop your dog eating poo
No matter what the cause, ensure your dog’s environment is clean and you go with them when they go out to the toilet. Once the causes are addressed, reducing your dog’s opportunity to eat poo considerably speeds up changing the habit.

Eating poo is a common issue, and you should investigate it as it might indicate something is wrong with your dog. But it isn’t that difficult to solve – simply look for the cause then follow the steps above to address it.

Should I feed my cat 'cat grass'?," 



Grass eating can help aid in your cat's digestion, as well as assisting them in coughing up hairballs after grooming. If your cat eats grass on a regular basis, it may help to prevent the build-up of hairballs in their stomach. Indoor cats do not have access to grass growing outdoors, so growing cat grass at home will ensure they are still able to access some.

Grass seeds can be bought in a number of places - from garden centres to supermarkets, so they're readily available and quite cheap to purchase too. Our video above shows you how to plant them, and when to give them to your cat.
Still have some questions?

Insuring your pet: what you need to know,"


Giving you peace of mind
All pets homed from Woodgreen come with four weeks of free cover from Petplan, which you can find out more about by contacting us. Beyond that, there's plenty of options – but which one is right for you? We're here to help you decide!
Choosing the right cover for you
As with all insurance, premiums can vary significantly, as can what is covered. Make sure you shop around and read the small print carefully. For example, some companies will pay the vet directly but others will require you to pay them and will then reimburse you – this can be quite an expensive way of making a claim.

Most companies will not provide cover for any pre-existing conditions and there will be an excess to pay on claims you make. Each company will often have several levels of insurance, that will vary, but the following is a rough guide:
12-month cover
This will cover your pet for an accident or illness for a 12 month period up to a set amount (e.g. £3,000) per condition. If you make a claim for a condition within this time you will no longer be able to make a further claim for the same condition once the 12 months has expired. This type of policy is useful if you own an older pet, or one with several pre-existing conditions, that would not be covered anyway. Also, if you can’t afford a higher premium, some cover is better than none.
Lifetime cover
This will provide cover for ongoing illnesses throughout your pet's life, provided you don’t take a break in your cover, up to a set amount each policy year (e.g. £4000-£7000). Third-party liability insurance will be included here. This type of policy means you can claim for the same problem more than once.
Top lifetime cover
Some companies offer a ‘premium’ lifetime cover that offers the same benefits as the standard cover but with a higher claim amount (e.g. up to £14,000).
Third party insurance
Some companies offer stand-alone third party insurance, which covers veterinary costs and legal cover if your pet causes an accident or attacks another animal.

What to do about your cat's hairballs,"



Normally, the hair travels through their intestine and is passed in faeces. When this doesn’t happen, your cat will regurgitate and vomit up the hairball instead. If the vomiting is persistent, then you should contact your vet.

What are the signs of cat hairballs?

 	Seeing the hairball itself
 	Retching and vomiting

How are cat hairballs treated?
There are a number of products your vet may recommend to treat hairballs, most of them are lubricant based. This helps the hairball pass through the intestines more easily. There also some diets that claim to help the prevention of hairballs – speak to your vet for advice on these.
If your cat is vomiting persistently due to hairballs, your vet may carry out routine blood tests to ensure there’s not an underlying condition.
It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you start any treatment.

How do I stop my cat getting hairballs?
The best way to help prevent hairballs is by grooming your cat. Regular grooming will limit the amount of hair your cat ingests, decreasing the amount of hairballs they produce.

If you’re thinking of adopting a cat with hairballs
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new pet and ask for more details on how the hairballs have been treated. You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any pet who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.

Bereaved cats: what you need to know,"How can I tell if my cat is dealing with bereavement?
Recently bereaved cats may be anxious, confused, act abnormally, be off their food, start to spray in the home or wander around the house calling loudly.
Some cats have a very noticeable change of character when they lose a member of the household. They may become far more outgoing, affectionate or completely withdrawn. Many other cats will not react at all to the bereavement. This is also completely normal, the cat may have lived quite happily with the other cat but never relied upon their companionship.

How can I help my cat cope with the bereavement?
The best remedy for a bereaved cat is to give them extra attention, affection and tempting food. If necessary, there are products which might help relax your cat like Feliway, which releases a synthetic facial pheromone that helps reassure them. If your cat can’t be tempted into eating, consult your vet for advice. Should I introduce a new cat straight away?
It’s very important to leave a period of time before considering introducing a new cat to your house. Remember your cat is not missing the general company of any cat, but the specific deceased cat.
If you see your cat’s personality change in a positive way, then really consider whether you should introduce a new cat to the house. Cats are emotionally different to humans, you may find that your existing cat blossoms after the loss of another cat in the house.

I have decided my cat will benefit from a new cat in the house, what should I do?
If you introduce a new cat too early both could become depressed, aggressive or territorial. If the introduction is done at the right time, the cats can cope with the experience and learn to live together.
Once your cat seems over their bereavement, we would suggest another cat of a similar age and activity level is the best mix. Take a look at further information on introducing new cats to your existing ones or search for cats looking for homes.         "
The right exercise for your dog," 








Careful exercising for puppies and dogs
If you have a puppy, gradually build up the amount of their exercise until they’re a year old. If your puppy is a large breed, don’t over exercise them as this may cause health problems.
Make sure you train your dog to return to you confidently before you let them run off the lead.

Fun exercising for dogs
The type and amount of exercise your dog needs depends on their breed and their age.
Young and middle aged dogs need two to five periods of activity and exercise daily. Elderly dogs often enjoy a short walk twice a day – regular but not strenuous exercise helps keeps mature dogs fit and well.
Dogs bred for herding like collies and German Shepherds need to have something to chase like a ball or Frisbee. Retrievers and spaniels love to play hide and seek with toys on walks and bring them back to you.
Terriers love to explore different places and smells on their walks and may like a dig tray or sand pit in the garden that they can explore.
Dogs can get bored if they’re taken on the same walks and routines every day. Try introducing different games and training sessions while exercising your dog to keep their walks fun and interesting.

Safe exercising for dogs
Make sure your dog has a correctly fitted collar with tag and is microchipped – that way they can be identified if they ever get lost while you’re out.
If your dog pulls on their lead, consider using a dog harness or head collar instead of a standard lead – this will give you extra control when you’re walking.

How to make a pet friendly garden,"Pet-friendly gardens for cats

 	Begin with the area by your door or cat flap: is there space for a bolt hole?
 	Cats like to feel they can run for cover so plant pots or small shrubs are perfect.
 	Cats enjoy climbing and high spots where they can survey their territory. Logs or trees with open growth are perfect for climbing, scratching and conditioning claws.
 	To encourage your cat to toilet outside, find a sheltered space to put in some loose, non-toxic sand.
 	Create a mix of sun spots for your cat to relax in and shelter from the midday sun.
 	Take note of which plants may be poisonous to your cat

Pet-friendly gardens for dogs

 	Dogs love gardens – most of all, they like you to be in the garden with them!
 	Grassy areas are ideal for scattering food, retrieving toys and games of tug. Try to avoid gravel areas; it’s hard on paws and hot in the summer.
 	For dogs who love digging, add a sandpit to give them space for their fun without destroying the flowerbed – stay with them and teach your dog the rules!
 	Poisonous plants can be a worry, especially for puppies and young dogs. Take note of which plants may be poisonous to your dog
 	Supervision and distraction using a toy is the golden rule.

Pet-friendly gardens for small pets

 	Small pets love tasty treats from your vegetable patch but make sure you follow our diet guide: see our tips on feeding rabbits and guinea pigs.
 	Blackberry bramble leaves are superb for keeping their digestive systems healthy. For guinea pigs, pick and scatter the leaves. Rabbits enjoy a whole strip of bramble, including the thorns.
 	Recycle your plastic plant pots – stuff them with hay and fresh picked forage, perfect for rabbits and guinea pigs to browse.
 	Tunnels, cardboard boxes, trays filled with soil/play sand and large willow or apple tree logs make perfect enrichment for their run, especially rabbits.
 	Guinea pigs enjoy piles of fluffy hay and hides to run between and shelter.
 	Take note of which plants may be poisonous to your small pets, rabbits or guinea pigs.

How to make your cats feel at home," 



Here are some ideas to help you maintain your cat’s physical and psychological well-being and cater to their individual needs.

Think about how you feed your cat
Most cats will have always been fed from a bowl. Try stimulating your cat by hiding treats around the home for them to find, this will make feeding time more fun! You can also buy or make special feeders like puzzle feeders or treat balls. Introduce these gradually so your cat has time to get used to them. Whilst most cats enjoy the challenge of a puzzle feeder, there will always be the odd exception of a cat who prefers to eat their food from a bowl.
Automatic pet feeders are very useful if you want your cat to eat specific amounts at set times. The voice activated ones work well, as you can record your voice calling your cat and set it for 4am. This way your cat eats at the time they would normally wake you up to be fed, play, or let out to hunt.

Lots of ways to drink water
Keep food and water bowls separately. Remember that cats are lactose intolerant, so milk is not a good replacement for water. Cats will often only drink from something that their whiskers don’t have to touch (this is why they often drink from a full glass of water).
Encourage your cat to drink by offering larger water bowls, water fountains, or a running tap, as these stimulate your cat’s desire to drink and are great way to keep them occupied.

Toileting areas
Cats need several options for toileting. Allow for one litter tray per cat plus one, placed away from each other in areas where they won’t get disturbed.
Litter trays come in a variety of sizes, and can be open or covered, if you want to provide your cats with more privacy. Buying a litter tray that suits your cat’s size means they are more likely to use it and won’t make the mistake of toileting over the edge of an open tray.

Relaxation and sleep
Quite often cats like places out of the way or high up. On top of the fridge or underneath a chair are often favourites, so they’re well protected and undisturbed whilst they sleep. Provide your cat with a nice comfy bed in the areas of their choice. Also consider cat beds that incorporate perch and hide opportunities, like radiator or covered beds.
There are also complimentary products available which can relax cats, relieve their anxiety and help them get along together. Feline diffusers can help your cat feel more relaxed in the home, some are specifically designed to help improve relationships between cats. Cat anxiety remedies, available in tablets or as supplements, can take the edge off any anxious feelings your cat may have. Discuss with your vet which supplements may be suitable for your cat.

Plenty of scratching areas
Give your cats at least one scratching area like a sturdy scratching post, scratch pad (old carpet tile) or disposable scratcher. Where possible vertical scratching posts must be high enough for the cat to stretch up and scratch and placed in entrances and exits of rooms. Your cat may also like a carpet tile to scratch in these areas as well.
Scratching is a form of scent marking and something you should encourage. Let your cat build up a scent profile around their home, to feel safe and secure. Your cat will get distressed if another cat enters their territory – a microchip cat flap will prevent any unwanted visitors.




 The importance of hiding and perching
Your cat should have the option to hide and perch. Give them an upturned sturdy cardboard box (big enough for your cat to lie in, turn around in and sit on top of), a chair with a large towel draped over it, or similar items in your home. If possible, there should be hiding and perching options in all rooms and floors of your cat’s home.

Jumping and climbing
All cats should have the opportunity to climb and jump up high. You could use tree branches for ramps, provide platforms and sturdy cardboard boxes, tall scratching posts and even let them explore shelving – minus the ornaments, of course.

Playing, hunting and mental stimulation
Encourage your cat to play with toys and rotate them regularly to prevent over-familiarity and boredom. Use toys that emulate the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat. If your cat likes to play predatory games, then play with them at various times throughout day with a suitable toy. Some examples of predatory toys to mentally stimulate your cat are:


 	String toys
 	Feather toys
 	Ping pong balls
 	Cat nip toys
 	Stalking toys

When playing with your cat, remember to give a food reward to finish off the natural hunting sequence – Locate, Stalk, Chase, Pounce, Kill, Dissect and Eat.  Avoid any toys (like laser pens) that do not allow your cat to follow this natural hunting sequence, as this can cause your cat to get frustrated and redirect this frustration on to you. If you do use one of these toys, finish the game by offering a toy for your cat to ‘kill' and a tasty treat afterwards.        "
Fleas and ticks,"What are fleas?
Fleas are tiny insects that feed off the blood of our pets. A common error we can make is only treating our pets when we see a flea. Did you know that for every 5 fleas you see on your pet, there are approximately 95 in your home? Fleas tend to live and lay eggs in the environment, jump on our pets to feed, then lay eggs in the environment again. These eggs can then hatch within 2 – 16 days, live in cracks and crevices such as skirting boards and under carpets, and then the life cycle begins again. This is why by the time you actually see an adult flea, you will already have quite a large infestation.
Are fleas harmful to our pets?
Fleas cause our pets to be itchy and uncomfortable. Some pets tolerate fleas better than others and can show very few physical signs. Others can have varying hypersensitivity to flea saliva, resulting in itchy spots at the site of the bites, fur loss, and even secondary bacterial infections. This is called Flea Allergic Dermatitis. Large or prolonged infestations can cause our pets to become anaemic and have a general loss of condition. This is particularly dangerous for pets that are already ill or are elderly.
Are fleas harmful to humans?
Although not as common, fleas can also feed on and bite humans, causing us to become itchy as a result.
How do I stop fleas?

 	Treat ALL pets in the home. There are many types of fleas including cat, dog and rabbit fleas, and many of these can be passed between species.
 	Use a vet or SQP recommended product for your pets lifestyle. These can be purchased from your vet, a locked cabinet in a pet store, or a reputable online retailer. It is always best to speak to a veterinary professional regarding which product is best for your pet. Some products treat just fleas, others treat fleas and ticks, and each product kills the parasites at different life stages. Products you can pick up from the shelves of supermarkets or pet stores yourself are often not strong enough to work effectively.
 	Treat your pets regularly to prevent a flea issue occurring in the first place. Depending on the product you choose, your pet will need treating every 4 to 12 weeks. Treating one pet for three months as a preventative measure costs an average of £10 (that’s £3.33 a month). Once you have a flea problem, it takes on average 3 months to eradicate (sometimes even longer), averaging at about £40.

Note: Never treat a cat with dog treatment and vice-versa as this can be toxic, particularly for cats.
How do I treat an existing flea infestation?

 	Kill the adult flea on your pet using a Vet/SQP recommended product regularly. We recommend choosing a product with larvicidal properties (kills larvae or immature parasites) and adulticidal properties (kills adult parasites) as this gives significantly better control.
 	Kill developmental stages of the lifecycle by treating your home. Treat your home with an insecticidal spray to kill any existing larva in the environment and to stop existing eggs developing. A good all-round insecticidal spray is ‘Indorex defence spray’. Before treating your home, hoover thoroughly as this encourages any eggs to hatch.

Directions for indorex:

 	Ensure the room is well-ventilated and any children or pets removed during and 2 hours after treatment.
 	If you have fish or reptiles that you cannot move out of the room, ensure they are in an air tight container and covered with a blanket and follow the instructions on the back of the can. This treatment is particularly toxic to fish and reptiles.
 	Concentrate on dark places, such as under sofas and units and cracks and crevices such as skirting boards.
 	Do not spray directly onto pets.
 	Once treated, this spray protects your home for up to a year.

Wash all bedding, cushions covers, blankets etc. on a hot wash. This eradicates any eggs that may be living on them.

Note: Fleas can carry the tapeworm parasite and can pose a risk to your household. If a flea carrying the tapeworm parasite is ingested by your pet, such as during grooming, or by humans accidentally, it can develop into a tapeworm infestation. Young children and young pets are more at risk of obtaining a tapeworm infestation than adults.  If your pet is showing fleas, check their worming product and ensure it protects against tapeworm.
Why do I still have fleas?
It can take several months eradicate an existing flea problem. Adult fleas will continue to live until they feed on your pet. As long as your pet remains up to date with treatment, the adult fleas will eventually die out as and when they choose to feed or are exposed to a flea product.
What are ticks?
Ticks wait on vegetation for a convenient host to walk by, where they then attach onto your pets and feed off their blood. Ticks can start as small as a pinhead and grow up to 1cm as they feed. They are often difficult to spot, especially when small and they commonly are mistaken for skin tags.
Are ticks harmful to pets?
Having a tick can be uncomfortable for your pet and in some cases can cause anaemia, particularly if your pet has more than one at once. Some ticks can also carry Lyme Disease. Lyme Disease is a bacterial infection and can make your pet lethargic, give them swollen joints and a temperature amongst other symptoms. Although Lyme Disease isn’t common, it’s important to be aware of it and prevent ticks where you can to eliminate the risk.
Are ticks harmful to humans?
Some ticks carry Lymes Disease which can be transferred onto humans if a tick bites you. A common sign of Lymes Disease in humans is a bullseye rash at the site of the bite. If you suspect you have been bitten by a tick, seek medical advice as soon as possible.
How do I stop ticks?

 	Treat ALL pets in the home for ticks, regularly. Many (but not all) flea treatments also help protect your pet against ticks.
 	Avoid tick hot spots – ticks are common in wooded and moorland areas, particularly in long grass. If you know ticks are particularly prevalent in your area, try sticking to paths.
 	Check your pet regularly. By health checking your pet regularly from head to toe, you will ensure existing ticks can be dealt with as soon as possible. The most common place ticks are found include the head, ears, legs and stomach however they can be found pretty much anywhere on your pets body. They can look like skin tags at first and vary in colour. If you look closely you may be able to see legs. If you unsure if you have found a tick, seek advice from a vet.

How do I remove a tick?
The safest way to remove a tick is by using a special tick removal tool. These can be purchased at most vets and pet shops. Never remove a tick by pulling, crushing or squeezing as this normally results in ticks mouth pieces remaining in your pet and becoming infected.

 	Put the tool under the tick as close to the skin as possible.
 	Twist the tool in one direction until you feel the tick loosen from your pet. Do not pull the tick, it will loosen as you twist.
 	Slowly lift the tool away when you feel the tick loosen, it should stay trapped in the hook.
 	After removing the tick, clean the area and monitor your pet for any signs of illness.
 	Seek advice from your vet if your pet is showing signs of being unwell.
 	If you are not confident removing a tick yourself, take your pet to a vet or call them for advice.

How to use food in training," 









Dogs can't survive without food – in the wild, they’re foragers and scavengers. Generally, dogs will do most things you ask of them if motivated by the right amount of food.
When training, food can be divided up into three levels - high value, medium value and low value. This is because some dogs need a little bit more incentive than others for learning and motivation.


 	High value food. If you're trying to train your dog to do something new, you’ll need to use high value food. This could be hot dog sausages or ham or cheese, perhaps some roast chicken – you can even make your own
 	Medium value food. If you’re finishing off training a behaviour your dog has nearly mastered and you’re in a less distracting environment, you can use medium value food, in the form of shop bought treats – keep an eye on additives, colourings and the amount of sugar or salt
 	Low value food. When your dog has mastered their training and you just want them to keep on top of it, you can use low value food – kibble.  This can be a handful of your dog’s recommended daily allowance if you feed them kibble. If not, you buy it from your local pet store.

Using food in training means your dog will be happy doing their work. They love food so they’re going to have a really happy emotional state throughout their learning.
You might be concerned your dog will only listen to you if you’ve got food in your hand. Don’t worry about this – once your dog is trained, you can start introducing the food every other time and then one in three times. Eventually, they’ll get the idea that doing what you say is good, and rewards come randomly.
If you have any concerns about using food in training or you’re struggling to get your dog motivated by food please contact us for further information.

Your cat's weight - what you need to know,"How much should I feed my cat?
To help prevent weight gain with your cat, we would suggest weighing their dried food. When free feeding (leaving unmeasured amounts of food down all day), it is very easy to overfeed them. They may also become bored with this routine and either eat too much or alternatively, lose their appetite.
For an average cat, 2 sachets of complete wet food and 30-40g of good quality dried food is enough for the day (this may vary slightly depending on brand). Providing this food in small meals throughout the day is best, if possible. This pattern will prevent them overeating as well as replicate their natural feeding pattern.

Make feeding time fun
Making feeding time fun for your cat by enrichment feeding them will not only help stimulate their minds, it will also help to slow down their eating and provide exercise for them. If your cat is driven by food, then playing games such as throwing their biscuits and getting them to chase them will get them moving as they chase their tasty treats. For more ideas on enrichment feeding, please click here.
For multi-cat households where one cat may be more food orientated than the others, we would suggest using microchip feeders. These will only open up for the cat who is registered to that feeder. This should be done along with providing separate feeding stations for each cat, allowing them to have their own resources and space.

Provide enrichment
Outdoor access for your cat will provide them with the space to exhibit natural behaviours as well as exercise and maintain a healthy body. If you are unable to provide this space, then please take a look at our enrichment ideas for indoors. How to measure your cat's body condition
Any diet plans should be discussed with your vet first as losing weight too quickly can cause other medical issues. Please note, quantities may also differ if your cat is on a prescription diet. Any changes to this should always be discussed with a vet.

Dogs and water - keeping them safe,"Whilst human sun lovers might relish this news, others may dread it.  Heat takes lives, the elderly, those with chronic health conditions, and those that don’t respect the effects of too much time in the sun can pay the ultimate price. The same applies to our dogs.
As we know, dogs are a social species - they love company, and one of the highlights of their day is heading out for their walks with their owners. In hot weather, dogs should only be walked at dawn or dusk when it’s cooler. Contrary to popular belief, dogs don’t always recognise that they are overheating, and keep going. They chase after the ball as many times as their owner throws it.  They rarely ever step outside and say ‘oh, it’s a bit too warm for me, I’ll stay home thank you very much’.
One of the excuses owners give for having fun in the sun with their dogs is that they participate in water based activities. If their dogs are wet, they must be cool, right?  The answer is maybe, but are we looking at the big picture? Are we looking at the hazards that come with fun and water?
Water-based activities include swimming in the sea, swimming in lakes, retrieving toys from lakes, swimming in rivers, and biting at water that comes out of hoses.

Swimming in the sea
Firstly, on a hot day the sand can get extremely hot and uncomfortable. We wear flip-flops for a reason! Secondly, you need to know about the times of the tide on the beach you are using, especially for the more confident canine swimmers that travel away from the shoreline.  There is also the risk of your dog entering a rip tide which could be very serious. Thirdly, some dogs drink sea water.  This can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration. Sadly if left untreated, this can result in death, so care must be taken to provide regular breaks and plenty of fresh water for them to drink. Swimming in lakes and rivers
When it comes to swimming in lakes, it is very important that you have researched whether the lake could be affected by Blue Green Algae. It isn’t always easy to spot with the naked eye, but can be fatal to our dogs. They don’t even have to drink it to be at risk, it can be absorbed through their pads.
Another concern for lakes is that owners like to throw items into the water for their dog to retrieve.  There are a few risks involved in this activity that you may not have thought about. Firstly, there is the risk of hidden branches in the water. There have been cases where a dog has jumped in to a lake only to get stabbed or impaled on an upturned stick.  There is also the risk of water reeds getting caught around the dogs legs, and thus pulling them under the water. Water fowl have babies throughout the summer months, and only recently a dog was drowned by a swan that was protecting its young.
Rivers are also a popular destination, the same risks apply to swimming in lakes, but two additional concerns are that river banks are often quite steep. Swimming is a very tiring activity, so when they’ve had their fun climbing up a steep bank to get out of the water can be very challenging. Many an owner has fallen in trying to help their dog get out of the water.  Another thing to consider when allowing your dog to swim in rivers is the strength of the current. Tired dogs can easily get swept away and into trouble.

Biting at water from hoses
Finally, there is the home entertainment of allowing our dogs to bite at the water as it comes out of a garden hose. As these dogs get excited, they grab quicker and harder at the water. This often results in the water stream going straight down their throats. Not only is there a risk that some of this water could end up in their lungs, but a lot of it goes into their stomachs, and can potentially cause water intoxication.
Water intoxication occurs when a dog takes in too much water. This happens when they do a lot of water retrieves as their mouth is open to hold the item, therefore they just swallow the water that goes into their mouths whether they are thirsty or not. It also happens when they bite at water coming out of a hose. Whilst this risk is not particularly high, it’s still a risk, and one that can be avoided.

Keeping your dog cool
As responsible owners, it is our duty to ensure the safety of our dogs. Managing their comfort in hot weather is down to us.
Keeping windows and doors closed with the curtains drawn throughout daylight hours whilst a fan is moving the air around is a great way of keeping your dog cool. Leaving them at home rather than taking them on family outings is advised. Frozen stuffed kongs and calm mental stimulation games at home during extreme heat is an ideal way to keep your dog happy. A kids paddling pool that has been placed in the shade in the garden is nice for your dog to have a wallow in, and we also recommend using cool mats.
No dog has ever died from missing a walk or two, but sadly dogs have died from heat exhaustion after being walked in excessive heat.
Are all water activities out of the question? Absolutely not. Just be sure to know the facts, do your research, know what to look for, and remember to keep the activity calm. We all love our dogs and we want to ensure their safety.  If you have any further questions about keeping your dog cool in the summer, please contact us, and our team will be happy to help!       "

Make your own: activity box,"

There are many reasons why you should consider an activity box for your dog. From preventing boredom to encouraging problem solving, it’s a great way to keep them entertained.

Dogs are highly intelligent and need stimulation. By keeping them occupied, you could prevent unwanted behaviours such as destructive chewing and barking. If your dog ever gets overexcited when you have visitors, or they have a habit of getting up to mischief when you’re out, an activity box can keep them distracted.

So, what should you add to the activity box? Think about what your dog loves, giving them a selection of fun activities. If it’s your dog’s first box, include simple puzzles and give your four-legged friend a helping hand if needed. We want this to be fun and engaging for them, not too hard and frustrating.

Watch our video on how to make an activity box (also known as a ‘home alone’ box), and read on for more top tips!

  
You will need:

 	A cardboard box
 	Newspaper
 	1 Kong or activity ball
 	Plastic bottle
 	A selection of toys (different from the toys normally left out)
 	Long-lasting chew (such as antlers, or pigs ears)

Feel free to pick and choose out what to place in your box out of the list above!

Method:
Add the following into your cardboard box:
Newspaper balls
Take small handfuls of dinner biscuits or treats and wrap them in pieces of newspaper.
Filled cardboard tubes
Insert some biscuits in the middle of the tube and stuff the ends with paper or tissue for your dogs to work their way in to. You can also make small holes in the side and wedge treats in for extra fun!
Plastic bottle
Hide dry food and treats inside and watch them work out how to get them out. Make sure the ring and lid are removed.
Kong
Soak dinner biscuits in a little water or mix with meat/tinned fish and fill the Kong. Try pushing treats inside to add interest. The same can be done in an activity ball.

Home alone box
Dogs are very sociable animals and many don’t cope being left alone for long hours, so this also works well as a ‘home alone box’, which can be left out for periods of time when your dog is left home alone. You may come home to a bit of cardboard or newspaper mess, but at least you know that your dog has enjoyed being left home alone!
Please note that home alone boxes are there to occupy and distract a dog when home alone, but will not replace human company.

Pet epilepsy - what you need to know,"
What are the signs of epilepsy in pets?
If a pet is about to have an epileptic seizure, they may appear frightened and dazed, or hide or seek attention. Once the seizure begins, they will fall on their side. They may become stiff, chomp their jaw, salivate profusely, urinate, defecate, vocalize, and paddle with all four limbs. The seizure will generally last between 30 and 90 seconds.

Seizures most often occur while a pet is resting or asleep, often at night or in early morning. If your pet has a seizure, they will most likely have recovered from the after effects by the time you take them to the vet.

Generally, epileptic seizures are first seen in pets between one to four years of age. Behaviour following the seizure includes confusion and disorientation, aimless wandering, compulsive behaviour, blindness, pacing, increased thirst and increased appetite. Sometimes they may recover from the seizure immediately, sometimes it takes up to 24 hours.
How is pet epilepsy treated?
If your pet has  a seizure, your vet will carry out blood testing, a thyroid screening and testing for viruses to see if they have epilepsy. They may also analyse their urine. Additional tests that can be carried out include a CT scan or MRI. They may also recommend an spinal fluid analysis.

Medication such as phenobarbitone can be used to reduce the frequency of seizures. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before you begin diagnosis and treatment.
How do I avoid the problem reoccurring?
Unfortunately there is little you can do to prevent pet epilepsy - but many pets with epilepsy live happy and fulfilling lives.
If you’re thinking of adopting a pet with epilepsy
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new pet and ask for more details on how the epilepsy has been treated.  You’ll need to sign a disclaimer to confirm you’ve been made aware of the condition. Any pet who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.

How to spot if your pet has a cruciate ligament injury,"What are the signs of cruciate ligament damage in pets?
The most obvious sign is your pet limping on a hind limb accompanied by pain in that area. Your vet can diagnose the condition by manipulating your pet’s femur and tibia – if the tibia moves forward independent of the femur then the cruciate ligament is damaged.
How are cruciate ligament injuries in pets treated?
Your vet may suggest restricted cage rest and anti-inflammatories. However, most cases require surgery.

There are various surgical options such as a strong suture that replaces the ligament to hold the knee in place, a TPLO (tibial plateau levelling osteotomy) or TTA (tibial tuberosity advancement), both of which allow the knee to function without a ligament in place.

Your vet will discuss which option is most suitable for your pet depending on the severity of the ligament tear. It’s a good idea to discuss costs before you start treatment.
How do I avoid the cruciate injury reoccurring in my pet?
A long period of cage rest and restricted exercise is the best way to care for your pet after surgery - this is crucial to the success of the operation. The success rate of a cruciate repair is good but some pets do go on to develop arthritis later in life. Make sure your pet stays at a healthy weight after the operation to minimise their chances.
If you’re thinking of adopting a pet with a cruciate injury
Make sure you review the clinical history of your new pet and ask for more details on how the injury has been treated.

Any pet who’s had treatment is likely to have pet insurance exclusions, so it’s worth discussing potential on-going costs with your vet.          "
What to do if your pet is constipated,"What are the signs of pet constipation?

 	Hard, dry faeces, possibly with some blood or mucus on the surface
 	Frequent attempts at defecation with little or no production of poo.

How is pet constipation treated?
If you think your pet has constipation, your vet will perform a thorough examination and look for signs of dehydration such as loss of skin elasticity or tenting.

They may put your pet on intravenous fluids and lactulose-based medication to help with  their bowel movement. It’s a good idea to discuss costs with your vet before treatment.
How do I avoid constipation reoccurring in my pet?
Keep your pet well hydrated and try to include as much fibre in their diet as possible. If it’s a reoccurring problem, the vet may prescribe laxative medication on an ongoing basis.

When to put my dog to sleep,"

We can’t ask them how they’re feeling or if they’re in pain. But there are some simple things to keep an eye on if you’re worried your about your dog’s quality of life.
Your dog's quality of life – what to look out for:

 	Appetite isn’t as good as it used to be
 	Not drinking or drinking excessively
 	Withdrawn
 	No longer cleaning themselves
 	Loss of bladder or bowel control
 	Unable to get comfortable
 	Struggling to get up after resting
 	Lameness due to arthritis even when on pain relief
 	Not bothering to greet you after you’ve been away
 	Can no longer tolerate exercise

If you’re not sure, it’s worth asking friends or family if they see a change in your dog – when we live side by side with our pets it’s sometimes difficult to spot gradual deterioration. Ask them to be honest and try not to feel hurt if they say something you don’t want to hear.
Your vet can help you decide
It’s a good idea to talk things over with your vet, they can give you an expert opinion on how your dog is feeling.  Older dogs should have a full veterinary check up every six months as a matter of course to keep them happy and comfortable.

If you’re unable to provide your dog with the treatment they need, then unfortunately it’s time to consider euthanasia. If you don’t feel you can afford to euthanise your dog, speak to your vet as they may well be able to help you spread the cost.
The kindest thing you can do
Deciding when the time is right for your dog to be put to sleep is a deeply personal journey. Once you have decided it’s the right time, you may well feel doubt or regret. Remember, you made the decision to put an end to their suffering. There is no kinder thing you can do for your dog.

How to care for your dog in the hot weather," Top tips on keeping your dog cool

 	Keep your house cool by closing all doors, windows and curtains when the sun is bursting through your house. Switch on a fan to circulate as much cool air as possible and keep the hot air out!
 	Fill a couple of water bottles with water and stick them in the freezer. When they’re solid, wrap them in damp towels and place them in shaded areas of your home. Your furry friend will enjoy laying against the cool surface for some relief.
 	Brush up on your grooming schedule and get rid of their thick undercoat. Clipping their fur short, especially in the areas that are in contact with the ground will help your dog make the most of cooler surfaces.

Heatstroke and the symptoms
Heatstroke is a real risk for all dogs in hot weather. It’s worth getting clued up on the symptoms of heatstroke. These can include:

 	excessive panting
 	dribbling
 	confusion
 	unsteadiness
 	bright red gums
 	collapsing and even seizures.

If you think your dog has overheated, take them into the shade and cool them down gently with tepid water, particularly around their neck, head and groin. Contact a vet as soon as possible.
Hot cars and walks
You should avoid walking your four-legged friend during hot weather. Dogs may suffer heat-related illnesses after exercising, walking or playing. Even on mild days, dogs can overheat simply by being in the garden, resting in a hot room or spending a day on the beach. It’s worth talking your dog out for their walk early in the morning between 5am and 7am or in the late evening when it’s cooler.

Alternatively, it may be even safer to offer light training or enrichment at home. Your dog will love chilling in the shade with a frozen Kong or paddling pool.

This is the same for cars too, extra care should be taken if you’re dashing off on holiday and taking your canine companion with you. Dogs should never be left in cars during hot weather, as the temperature can rise to a scorching 47 degrees very quickly. If you’re unable to cope in the heat, neither will your beloved dog.
Beware of dog theft
As tempting as it is to leave your windows and doors open in the summer months, it can be an open invite to thieves who might be on the lookout for dogs. Dog thefts from unattended cars is ever-increasing. If you have to leave your dog home alone or you can’t keep an eye on your dog, make sure all windows and doors are locked, even when you’re not in the room.

Dogs and grass seeds: what to do,"


Grass seeds most commonly get stuck between toes, in ears, in eyes, and in the nose or mouth, but realistically any part of the body is at risk of puncturing.

Once a grass seed has broken the skin and entered the body, the risk to your dogs health begins. These seeds carry bacteria, and infection can occur very quickly. They also tend to travel through the body, and in the worst of situation,s they can cause severe damage to internal organs.

Symptoms that your dog has a grass seed will depend on where in the body it has entered. For paws, your dog is likely to be chewing and licking the area, and may limp due to the pain.  For ears, the dog may scratch and shake its head a lot. It may also yelp in pain when the area is touched. For the nose, the dog may do a lot of sneezing and develop a nose bleed.

Surgical intervention is nearly always the only way of helping your dog. This obviously causes a significant amount of stress to your dog, not to mention your bank balance.

In order to try and keep the risk to your dog to a minimum, we suggest ensuring that your dogs paws and ear hair are trimmed regularly so that the seeds don’t have as much to attach to. It is also advisable to avoid areas that contain a lot of grass seeds, such as verges and hay fields.

Finally, ensure that upon your return from every walk, you go over your dog thoroughly to check for any attached grass seeds. Be sure to pay particular attention to the ears and between their pads.

 Top tips on keeping your dog cool

 	Keep your house cool. You can do this by ensuring that your doors, windows and curtains are closed during the daylight hours. You need to keep the heat outside!  A fan on the floor to help circulate the air is beneficial too. You may find that your dog enjoys laying in front of it.
 	You can also put plastic bottles of water in the freezer, and then wrap them in a damp towel. The dog can then choose to lay against them if they wish. We also recommend purchasing cool mats for your dog to lay on.
 	Be sure to stay on top of your grooming schedule. Getting rid of their dead undercoat is very important. Clipping the coat short in the areas that are in contact with the floor when your dog lays down will help them take advantage of laying on cooler surfaces.
 	A paddling pool in a shady area of your garden is also a fun way of keeping your dog cool.
 	Stuffing a Kong type toy and putting it in the freezer also provides your dog with its own version of an ice-lolly.
 	Your dog will be at most risk during its walk.  The coolest time of day is between 5am and 7am.  This is the best time to walk your dog.  It is also advisable to stay in shaded wooded areas. The last thing you want to do is take toys out for your dog to chase. Dogs are not very good at regulating themselves during play, and most will just keep going until it’s too late. Short walks so your dog can sniff about at a slow or steady pace is a much better way of fulling his needs. Remember, no dog has ever died from not having a walk, but sadly many have when walked in excessive heat.

Enjoy the heat but just remember, your dogs needs are very different to ours.         "
How to care for your guinea pigs in the hot weather,"
Providing them with a cool environment will help them to feel comfortable and happy as well as keeping them safe from potential heat stroke and other heat related dangers.


 	Where possible, move outdoor enclosures into the most shaded area of your garden.
 	Use garden parasols, gazebos, or large white sheets to provide plenty of shade throughout the day.
 	The suns direction will move slowly throughout the day. Ensure that you have sufficient options to protect them at several angles to prevent them from suddenly becoming exposed.
 	Ensure that the enclosure has plenty of air flow and isn’t trapping in heat. Placing them out in the run on the grass in shade will be cooler than in a hutch.
 	If safe to do so, add a fan in any sheds, large hutches or indoor rooms where your guinea pigs will be. Ensure that the wires are tucked away or protected using some cable pipe protectors.
 	Add plenty of large fluffy piles of hay around the enclosure and over any tunnels etc to help keep these areas shaded.
 	Provide large shallow bowls of water and plenty of fresh picked forage to keep them hydrated.

Tips for going on holidays with dogs,"

Here's a few tips on how to get the most out of your next trip.
Many pet owners will be considering booking dog-friendly trips in the UK with their pooch. Here's a few tips on how to prepare so you and your dog can get the most out of your staycation.
It’s wise to think about the trip from your dog’s perspective. We instinctively consider this from our own position, but its wise to consider our dogs personalities too.

Preparing for travel
In current times, travel is an important consideration. If your dog loves the car and always wants to travel with you, there will be little change in their behaviour, even if they haven't been in the car over the last few months. While they might be a bit more restless and excited, on the whole your dog will be delighted to be going somewhere with you. A couple of short local journeys in the weeks leading up to your break away will help your dog to settle and be more prepared for a longer trip.
If your dog is an inexperienced car traveller, or is usually worried by car travel, then doing some preparation in the days and weeks before a longer journey will help.  Doing short journeys to and from their favourite walk area is ideal. This helps your dog get used to the motion of the car in really short bursts, and gives them an adventure in association with the journey. This works really well for dogs that enjoy their walks.
It’s a good idea to do some walks in new and unfamiliar locations. Try to find environments as similar to your holidays location as possible. Always take rewards and make it a positive experience. If your dog is still displaying nervous behaviour, we recommend getting advice as soon as possible from Woodgreen or your vet.

Reward-based training
Doing some basic reward-based training when out and about helps your dog maintain focus and engagement on walks. Recall is an area that needs particular attention. Even if your dog has a great recall at home, it’s not something that can be guaranteed in new places. If your holiday is in a location with livestock, in wildlife reserves or near cliffs, off-lead exercise might not be suitable. Even if you think off-lead will be an option, it’s still worth taking equipment that will enable enough freedom while also ensuring safety. A harness and a longline lead enables freedom to explore, but it also prevents chasing livestock, hunting, or running off a cliff top. When using a longline, it’s sensible to wear gloves as they prevent any friction burns. This is especially relevant with medium and large dogs.

Ensure their microchip details are up to date
Before you go, check your dog’s tag and make sure your contact information is current. It is a good idea to include the address of the campsite or hotel you will be staying at. Sometimes that can be challenging, especially if you are moving around and cannot provide an address. You could use an address of a friend or family member - ultimately, someone who knows you and your dog very well and would endeavour to get through to you, or be prepared to travel to collect your dog. Most importantly, do include a telephone number, and where possible, use more than one. It’s good to research the number and address of a vet local to the area you are staying in the event that your pooch may need to visit one.


 Avoid leaving your dog in a car
Every year we hear many terrible stories of dogs left in vehicles, and the outcome is often the worst imaginable. Dogs should never be left alone in a car, even on moderately warm days in just a few minutes the temperature can rise to dangerous levels. Do your research in advance and be sure to choose places to visit where dogs are allowed. We have more information about the dangers of leaving a dog in a car here.

Helping your dog in hot weather
Dogs are highly susceptible to heat stroke, so it’s critical take precautions. There are cool mats and cooling coats available, and these can be effective if they are used as per the instructions. Dogs can only lose heat through panting, or through their feet. Breeds that have shorter noses like boxers, pugs, Shih Tzu, etc, struggle as their breathing is less efficient than longer-nosed dogs. Extra caution needs to be taken with short nosed dogs, overweight dogs, the young, elderly, and dogs with health issues.
Plan your holiday activities to accommodate the temperature. Woodland walks might be better than sandy beaches, early morning and late evening walks need to replace walking during the day on hot days.
When the weather is hot, the ground surfaces like paving, tarmac, and sand become extremely hot. Always check the ground on sunny days before setting off - generally, soil and grass are cooler surfaces. Do the hand test – place the back of your hand on the ground for 5 seconds. If it’s too uncomfortably warm for you, it’s too hot for your dog's paws. We have more advice on helping your dog in hot weather.

Water safety
Many dogs love beach walks and it can lovely to see them running and playing in the sea. For beach trips, always take some fresh water and a bowl. Usually, dogs won’t drink salt water. However, if they are very hot and thirsty, some will. Dogs who grab at moving water, or who retrieve toys from the sea are at more risk of accidentally consuming dangerous levels of salt water. Limiting access to the waves and stopping toy play can help reduce this, and having plenty of fresh water is critically important if you see or suspect your dog may have consumed some salty water. Drinking salt water can and often does result in very watery diarrhoea. Here is our full guide to dogs and water safety.

Be mindful of clifftop walks
Clifftop walks can be beautiful and really interesting for everyone including your dog. However, from your dog’s perspective it’s difficult to see the cliff edge. When running, they are unable to stop in time, and in that environment the birds are especially likely to be near the edge and often take to the air from the cliff top. Keeping your dog on a harness and longline allows some freedom, but also gives you the peace of mind of knowing you can prevent any disasters occurring.
Thinking ahead will help you and your dog have a safe and fun packed holiday!

Can my pets eat pumpkin?,"Whether you are purchasing in a supermarket or farmers shop, or picking your own at a pumpkin picking field, many pet owners are not aware that pets can enjoy them too! Check below to see if pumpkin is safe for your pet.

What are the benefits of consuming pumpkin?
Pumpkin is packed full of vitamins A, C, E, and B, as well as minerals and fibre. In small amounts, pumpkin can help your pet to maintain a healthy digestive system, as well as act as an accompaniment to a healthy diet.
What pets can eat pumpkin?
Small pets

 	Gerbils can eat both the pumpkin and the seeds in moderation/small amounts.
 	Rabbits can eat fresh pumpkin in moderation/small amounts.
 	Rats, mice and hamsters can eat both the pumpkin and the seeds in moderation, and can also be fed some squashes too. Please note that hamsters should only be fed a portion the size of their ear, and seeds should be fed sparingly.
 	Degus, chinchillas, hedgehogs and guinea pigs should not be fed any pumpkin or pumpkin seeds at all.

Outdoor pets
Pigs, sheep, geese, ducks, goats and chickens can all eat fresh pumpkins. Break or smash them open and leave them in their enclosure for these pets to peck or munch on.

Remember, it is illegal to feed any kitchen scraps to these animals, so make sure you are not feeding them leftovers from carved pumpkins or pumpkins that have been prepared in any way in a kitchen.
Dogs 
Pumpkin is a tasty and healthy treat for dogs. It is full of fibre, so can be great for upset stomachs. We recommend that you only give your dog around 4-5 tablespoons a couple of times a week for a medium sized dog, as it could cause constipation.

For Kongs, you can mix it with natural yogurt, dog meat or other fruit and veg to your dog’s taste.

The pumpkin should always be fresh and dogs cannot have the rind, stem or pulp, as it may cause intestinal blockages.
Cats
Tinned pumpkin is good for cats digestive system, but in moderation - too much can cause diarrhoea.

Fresh pumpkin is good for cats to consume in small amounts - they'll love it cut up in chunks and steamed. As it is high in fibre, it can help to keep their stomachs healthy.

"You, your dog, and Covid-19","

Can coronavirus be passed on by dogs?
Current evidence suggests that humans cannot catch Covid-19 from your dog, and you cannot infect them with it either.

Dog walking
Those people who are self-isolating as a precaution (for example, working from home) or by means of protecting themselves from infection can still walk their dogs.
Obviously you need to keep away from other people, but some fresh air out in the countryside can help offset the effects of being alone indoors.
If you are self-isolating because you are showing symptoms or have tested positive, it is advised that you do not leave your house and garden. Whilst this might cause concern for dog owners owing to the inability to take their dogs for a walk, please don’t worry. There are lots of things you can do to keep your dog mentally stimulated:


 	Playing retrieve games in the house and/or garden will also help keep a lot of dogs happy.
 	Trick training is great fun too!  There are lots of tutorials online to guide you through the training.  Visit Woodgreen's YouTube channel for advice, or we recommend Kikopup
 	Scent games are also loved by lots of dogs. Just hide your dogs favourite toy or treats somewhere in the house or garden, and then encourage them to find it.
 	Enrichment feeding is an excellent way of occupying your dogs time, and challenging their brain. How to prevent boredom in dogs

How to keep your dog happy in the home
Dogs love company, and will be delighted that they are they have your companionship for longer than usual during a time when the nation is largely working at home and self-isolating. This means they're already happier than when they were being left home alone for short periods before. Is your dog suffering from separation anxiety?

Other things to consider

 	Make sure you’re well stocked up on food and medication for your dog, in case you have to self-isolate, or check whether you can get it delivered at this time.
 	Keep in touch with your veterinary practice and make sure you know their availability in case you need to use their services.
 	Always remember to keep washing your hands regularly, especially after handling your dogs.

The companionship that our beloved dogs give us in troubled times is immeasurable; remember they don’t have a clue what’s going on in the big wide world, they rely on us to keep them safe and healthy, so make sure you’re looking after yourself too.

Can your pet be vaccinated during the Covid-19 outbreak?,"


What vaccinations do your pets require?
Rabbits
Require vaccinations against myxomatosis &amp; RHVD 1 &amp;2 (Rabbit haemorrhagic viral disease strains 1 &amp; 2).
Ferrets
Ferrets require vaccinating against K9 distemper.
Cats
Cats must be vaccinated against feline enteritis, feline influenza (or cat flu), and if your cat goes outside, we recommend vaccinating them against feline leukaemia virus (FeLV). As long as your cat has had the vaccinations the previous year, they will still have a degree of cover, so can continue to go outside. Their vaccination would then need to be restarted once appointments are available again.
Dogs
A person who is not self-isolating can take your puppy or dog to the vets on your behalf.
Canine coronavirus is not Covid-19: Canine coronavirus is a long-established canine virus that causes diarrhoea. Please ask your vet for advice on your individual dogs circumstances.
Full list of vaccinations dogs
Vaccinating puppies
If your puppy hasn't been vaccinated, or his vaccination schedule has been delayed, there are things you can be doing to ensure he doesn't miss out on critical socialisation and habituation. A person who is not self-isolating can take the puppy/dog to the vets on your behalf. They should follow guidelines for washing hands, and if possible, use their own lead, and not a lead you need to touch or use. They should take some tasty treats from their home to help the dog hope with getting in and out of the car, and to cope with the vet visit. When they return, ensure you wipe the dogs coat down with dog or baby wipes. It's important to remember that dogs lick their coat, so anything used to wipe him or her down needs to be safe. If possible, the handover should take place in a secure area where they can detach the lead safely for you to collect your dog once they leave (such as an enclosed back garden).
COVID-19 changes for pets, and what you can do
Due to the current COVID-19 outbreak, all veterinary practices have been advised to reduce their appointments down to emergencies only, and initially this meant that vaccinations were put on hold. However, now that many practices have had the time to assess how best they can support their clients' needs in a safe way that follows the government's guidelines, many are now offering limited vaccinations services for pets who are at highest risk.

Please contact your vet practice to find out their policy on vaccinations at this time.

If your veterinary practice is currently not offering vaccinations, a few basic steps you can do to help keep your rabbits safe against myxomatosis include using mosquito nets around their enclosures, and discussing with your veterinary practice flea treatment options. If you have been out to get supplies, ensure you change your clothes and footwear, and wash your hands thoroughly before interacting with your rabbits to help reduce the chances of VHD.

"You, your cat, and Covid-19","

Can cats pass on Covid-19 to humans?
Although it is still rare, there is a very small possibility that we can pass Covid-19 to our cats. However, there is no evidence to suggest that cats can pass the virus to humans or that cats can pass it to other cats. It is important that you continue to allow your cat access to go outside, as long as the cat is neutered and vaccinated, especially if your cat has always had the freedom to come and go as she pleases.
There is currently no evidence that cats can carry the virus on their fur. However, if you, or anyone in your home, has symptoms of Covid-19, to minimise the risk to other people who may wish to stroke your cat outside of your home, it’s advisable to take precautions such as restricting direct contact with your cat as much as possible, washing your hands after you have stroked your cat and wearing a face mask if possible.
When your cat comes home from being outside, follow the same precautions as you would after opening post or touching a door handle and wash your hands thoroughly. If you would like to wipe your cat down after she comes in from outside, please only use a damp cloth or a safe pet wipe specifically designed for cats. Please do not use any form of disinfectant, bleach or any other chemicals as these can be very toxic to cats.

Keeping your cat indoors?
When cats go outside, they have the opportunity to exhibit their natural hunting instincts. Having this access restricted will mean that your cat needs an appropriate outlet for these behaviours in the home. If you are currently keeping your cats indoors or restricting their access, then it’s important to remember that while some cats may adapt to this, others could become stressed and potential changes in their behaviour may occur.

Provide enrichment
Providing a variety of toys will mean your cat is able to have a choice of what they play with. This should include toys you can use to interact with them.  Feathers on a stick are always a favourite for them to chase around. Providing them with other toys that they can then kick at and follow with giving your cat a tasty treat will help them to complete their natural hunting pattern. Also, having scratching facilities in the house such as sturdy scratching posts where they can scratch and stretch will be very much appreciated by your feline friends.
For some cats, creating a game with their food could also provide them with that much needed mental stimulation. Something as simple as throwing their biscuits so they chase them, or hiding food in cardboard tubes will keep their minds working while also providing them with some exercise. If this is something you have decided to do, please make sure that they are supervised for the first time.

Give them some space
While being at home with our cats more is something that we are going to enjoy, we need to remember that they are likely used to being alone and sleeping in their favourite spots while you are out at work and school. On average a cat will sleep around 16 hours a day therefore making sure they still have this space if they want to and not overwhelming them with unwanted attention will help to keep them calm and relaxed.

Provide access to litter trays
Some cats will be used to toileting outside rather than in a litter tray. If you are keeping them in, a suitable tray and litter will need to be in place. This may mean using soil if they are used to going outside.
Litter trays should be in a quieter part of the house where the cat can easily access them and should be cleaned regularly. If you have more than one cat we suggest a tray each, plus one. These should be in separate parts of the home where possible rather than all in one area.

Are vets continuing to operate during this time?
Currently, vets are not carrying out non-urgent procedures - this includes neutering and vaccinations. If your kitten is not yet neutered and has not had its primary vaccinations, we recommend keeping it indoors during this time to avoid unwanted pregnancies and exposure to disease.
Female cats can get pregnant from as early as 16 weeks of age, so if you have two kittens of both sexes, ensure they are kept apart from this age to prevent them from mating, even if they are siblings. If your cat needs veterinary care, phone your vets first to find out what their current procedures are for arranging veterinary check-ups.

Other things to consider

 	If you are able to get a shopping trip in before self-isolation, buying a little extra food for your pet than you normally would buy is a good idea, so that you’re able to feed them for the duration of your time indoors. Also, be sure to check that you have enough medication at home if your cat is on regular treatment.
 	It might also be worth seeing if a family member or close friend is in a position to look after your cat for you should you suffer from more serious symptoms.

Remember to follow good hygiene rules and wash your hands regularly.
The companionship that our pets give us during our times of need is immeasurable; they have no idea what’s going on in the big wide world because their world revolves around their owners.  Keep yourself safe and they’ll stay safe too.

If you’re looking for some activities to keep you and your children entertained, why not try making some enrichment toys to give to your ferrets? Pet advice for kids

Other things to consider

 	Make sure you’re well stocked up on food and medication for your pets, in case you have to self-isolate, or check whether you can get it delivered at this time.
 	As ferrets are possibly susceptible to catching the virus, a plan should be in place to ensure that they are well cared for, but contact with yourself is kept to a minimum if you find yourself becoming unwell. During this time, adding new enrichment and using feed balls rather than bowls can help keep them entertained whilst interaction is reduced.
 	During the cleaning of small pets like ferrets, make sure you’re in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside to make sure dusty bedding doesn’t irritate any existing symptoms you may have.
 	Keep in touch with your veterinary practice and make sure you know their availability in case you need to use their services.
 	Always remember to keep washing your hands regularly, especially after handling your ferrets.

The companionship that our beloved pets give us in troubled times is immeasurable; remember they don’t have a clue what’s going on in the big wide world, they rely on us to keep them safe and healthy, so make sure you’re looking after yourself too.

How to make a catnip sock,"


It’s no secret that cats are natural born hunters. They absolutely love to play and have a natural ability to hunt. In fact, they get a great deal of enjoyment and satisfaction from it. So if you’re feeling creative and want to make a toy for your cat that will keep them mentally stimulated and relaxed, this catnip sock is just the ticket!

Your cat will spend hours grabbing it with their paws and throwing it around before settling down for a well-deserved snooze.

Check out the video below for instructions and find out everything you need to get started!


  

What you need

 	Pair of socks
 	Catnip
 	Shredded paper, toilet roll tube, or stuffing

What to do

 	Grab a sock and fill it with shredded paper. Make sure to stuff it down to the toe of the sock.
 	Keep stuffing until the sock is filled half-way.
 	Take a pinch of catnip and sprinkle into the sock.
 	Top up with another handful of shredded paper.
 	Next, pinch the sock where the shredded paper is and twist the sock a few times to seal.
 	Fold the sock back over itself to secure.
 	Give the toy a bit of a squeeze into shape.

Alternative methods
If you don’t fancy getting shredded paper everywhere, you can simply push a toilet roll tube into the sock, fill with a pinch of catnip and secure the sock as above. Or for a super plush, cuddly toy, you can replace the shredded paper with stuffing.

Owning a cockerel and why they make great pets,"Owning a cockerel is a wonderful experience and they make great pets too. In this article, we explore the reasons why cockerels are brought in as unwanted pets, discuss the misconceptions and explain the joys of introducing one to your flock.
Why are cockerels brought to us?
The number of cockerels waiting to come to our centre is ever-increasing and this is down to the popular activity of hatching chicks. This is usually seen in classrooms, households and early years education where fertilised eggs are kept in an incubator and hatch into chicks. In some garden set-ups, others allow their hens to sit on their eggs which eventually hatch into chicks. Although this could seem like an effective and practical way of teaching children about the life cycle of an animal, in reality, the majority of the hatched chicks could be cockerels and their future could be somewhat uncertain.

We often see an increase in calls in the springtime from teachers who often take on hatched chickens themselves. Most schools return the chicks to the farmer who gave them the eggs, but to help the males live fulfilling lives, teachers contact us in the hope that we can find them new homes. Although we like to take in as many as we can, unfortunately, we don’t always have the space. Cockerels don’t tend to live together or within close proximity of one another due to the noise and behavioural issues that can occur.

Here at Woodgreen, we’re keen for chicken owners to consider adding a cockerel to their brood. We also want to encourage children to learn about the full life and needs of a chicken, rather than just the first few weeks of its life.
Cockerel rehoming
Many rescue centres and organisations including Woodgreen have lots of cockerels looking for new homes. Unfortunately, cockerels are known to make quite a racket, especially in the mornings. And while this isn’t much of a problem in the countryside, more and more people are getting chickens in urban areas and the addition of a cockerel can risk upsetting neighbours. Because of this, lots of cockerels find their way to Woodgreen. While they’re with us, we’ll either set them up with a group of hens, or rehome them to someone looking to add a cockerel to their brood.


The caring side of cockerels
Cockerels are renowned for being very loving and protective of their hens, making them a worthy addition to any flock. They often have a reputation of being noisy and aggressive, however, this is not true for a lot of them. Cockerels live happily in an environment that suits them. Some may be more suited to a larger brood and older children in the home because they can be more territorial. Others thrive in a smaller brood and will become part of the family.

They’re great at protecting and defending their hens from any potential threats and predators – you will often find them on patrol, marching around their enclosure on the lookout for any danger. They will also help to keep the girls in order, preventing any bickering or fighting in the flock, especially when expanding the group.

When it comes to food, a cockerel is a true gent, he will let his hens know if he finds any tasty treats, or when food arrives. Then he will call them over so they can eat first before he digs in. He will even place any food he finds in front of his hens too, waiting on their hand and foot like royalty! Towards the end of the day at dusk, you’ll see him rounding up the hens and calling them into the coop for the night. Common misconceptions
A common misconception of cockerels is that you should only own a cockerel as a pet if you want to breed with your hens. This is not always the case. You can keep hens and a cockerel together without expanding the group. All you need to do is remove any eggs from sitting hens on a daily basis, just in case they are fertile. Otherwise, you might find that you have multiple cockerels. If your hens aren’t willing to easily move off their eggs, gently pick them up and move them off yourself and remove the eggs.
Cockerel rehoming: What to consider before bringing one home 
When making the decision to rehome a cockerel, make sure you talk to your neighbours first. Cockerels make for a reliable alarm clock, so it’s best to make sure they won’t mind any crowing early in the morning.

Before you bring a cockerel home, take the time to meet a few birds to help you find the right one for your family and your flock.

If you’re thinking about adopting a group of hens and want to find out more about their care, our free chicken e-learning family workshop is a great place to start! You’ll explore all the basic needs of a chicken and how to keep your flock happy and healthy. To see our full range of live and virtual workshops and classes, visit our website.

We have plenty of cockerels seeking loving homes with their girls or wanting to find a group of hens to settle down with. Take a look at our feathered friends available for rehoming here.         "
What plants or food are poisonous to dogs?,"Foods that are poisonous to dogs:

 	Chocolate contains the toxic compound theobromine, which is found in cocoa. The darker the chocolate, the more dangerous it is. Even in small quantities it can result in vomiting and diarrhoea, and as it’s a diuretic it can cause severe dehydration. More serious intoxication results in heart and brain problems requiring urgent veterinary attention
 	Raisins, currants, sultanas and grapes can cause kidney failure. Individual dogs react differently, so even a few grapes or a handful of raisins can be toxic. Initially they may develop vomiting and diarrhoea but then kidney failure can develop from 24-72 hours after ingestion. Reactions are unpredictable, so always seeking veterinary attention if they eat these foods. There have been reports of cats also being affected
 	Raw dough does not settle well with your dog's system, and so we recommend keeping any out of sight if you are making cakes or bread
 	Avocados contain a toxin called Persin. This causes upset stomachs in dogs, breathing difficulties and fluid buildup in the chest, but the stone is also very dangerous for them too. As it's slippery, it can accidentally be swallowed by dogs, leading to obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. This can also happen with peaches, nectarines and similar stoned fruits
 	Xylitol is an artificial sweetener. It’s harmless to humans but it can cause your dog's blood sugar to drop and can cause liver failure. Early symptoms include vomiting, lethargy, and coordination problems. Eventually, your dog may have seizures. Liver failure can happen within just a few days. Xylitol is often added to peanut butter so if you are using peanut butter for kongs, check ingredients first
 	Alcohol affects a dog’s liver and brain in the same way it affects people’s organs - but it takes a lot less to hurt your dog. Even a little beer, wine or spirits can be serious. It can cause vomiting, diarrhea, coordination problems, breathing problems, coma, even death. The smaller the dog, the worse it can be
 	Onions, garlic, leeks (also found in some stuffing) will initially cause vomiting and diarrhoea but after 1-5 days can result in anaemia. This can happen when eaten raw or cooked
 	Coffee, tea, and other caffeine can be fatal. Keep your dog away from coffee and tea, even the beans and the grounds, and energy drinks that have caffeine in too. Caffeine is also in some cold medicines and pain killers. If you think your dog had caffeine, take them to the vet as soon as possible
 	All nuts, particularly peanuts and macadamias are known to cause weakness, spasms, convulsions and gastrointestinal problems. As little as six macadamia nuts can be fatal to dogs. In particular, your dog should avoid chocolate coated nuts

Finally, medications such as paracetamol or ibuprofen are common in pain relievers and cold medicine, these can be deadly for your dog. Call your vet if your dog has consumed any of your medicines. Never give your dog any over-the-counter medicine unless your vet tells you to.
Plants that are toxic to dogs:


 	Amaryllis bulbs
 	Asparagus fern
 	Azalea cyclamen
 	Daffodil bulbs
 	Day lilies
 	Delphiniums
 	Foxgloves
 	Hemlock
 	Hyacinth
 	Hydrangea
 	Ivy
 	Laburnum lilies
 	Lily of the valley
 	Lupins
 	Mistletoe
 	Morning glory
 	Nightshade
 	Oleander
 	Poinsettia
 	Rhododendron
 	Rhubarb leaves
 	Sweet pea
 	Tulip bulbs
 	Umbrella plant
 	Wisteria
 	Yew

Dogs and houseplants
When you have a new or young dog it’s best to lift houseplants out of reach, especially when every new item seems to end up in your puppy’s mouth. Stay with them in the garden: if they show interest in any of the following plants, give them something else to do; like playing with a toy.
Cocoa bean garden mulch
Cocoa bean garden mulch is used in landscaping, often in public parks, so it’s worth keeping an eye out for this on your walks. Cocoa beans from the tropical cocoa tree contain theobromine, a product related to caffeine that humans assimilate very well, but dogs and cats can’t.

The risk is greatest to young dogs, because puppies and young dogs explore everything with their mouths: during this phase they chew on almost anything. Most cases of poisoning from cocoa mulch are relatively minor, but some dogs eat enough to become very sick, and it can even be fatal.
What to do in an emergency
It's best to call or visit a vet straight away. Then, get in touch if you need further support in the event of an emergency.

Money-saving tips," How much does it cost to own a pet?
It can vary hugely depending on their species, breed and individual needs. As a rough guideline, allow a monthly budget of around £100 for a dog, £80 for a cat and £80 for a pair of rabbits to cover the essentials – in addition to the initial up-front costs of getting the pet(s) and all the supplies they need. Bear in mind that small pets like rabbits, guinea pigs and rodents need to live with companions of their own kind, so you should always budget for having two.

This cost can be significantly higher for older pets, pets with ongoing medical conditions, large dogs and certain breeds, for example flat-faced dogs like French Bulldogs that are expensive to insure, as they usually suffer from more medical issues than other breeds. Before taking on a pet, please consider the ongoing costs and whether you will be able to afford them – both now and in the future.
Is preventative healthcare really worth it?
Yes, absolutely! Don’t underestimate how much money can be saved by preventing issues from occurring in the first place. There is a cost involved with neutering, microchipping, vaccinating and giving your pet regular flea and worming treatments, but you risk paying much more down the line if anything were to go wrong. Preventative healthcare is always a good investment and isn’t worth skimping on. Charities like Woodgreen can also help with neutering your pet.
Should I cancel my insurance policy to save money?
At Woodgreen, we always recommend insuring pets as it can save some hefty bills in the long run. Rather than cancelling your policy, shop around and use price comparison websites to make sure you’ve got the best policy for your pet, as you may find a cheaper option elsewhere. The best policies cover pre-existing conditions for life – if you don’t opt for this, ongoing conditions can become costly.

If you are struggling to meet the monthly cost of your insurance policy, another option is to contact your insurance provider and ask to drop the maximum level of cover, which will lower the monthly payments. A policy that covers your pet for up to £2,000 should be enough for most things like blood tests and basic procedures. This is better than having no cover and being faced with unexpected bills.
Is it possible to save money on vet bills?
Addressing medical issues at the first sign of sickness or injury is often cheaper in the long run, so it’s best to seek veterinary advice as soon as possible. Waiting to see if things “get better” can make treatment far more expensive.

If your pet is prescribed medication or a prescription diet, you don’t have to purchase it through your vet. Discuss with your vet the option of writing a prescription, as this can allow you to purchase the medication or food online at a cheaper cost.

You can also be registered with more than one vet. For pet owners who are on a low income or receive benefits, you may qualify for discounted veterinary treatment through the RSPCA or PDSA, depending on whether you fall into their catchment area. You can find out more about this by checking with your local RPSCA and PDSA clinics.
How much should I be spending on pet food?
A poor diet can cause problems with your pet’s teeth, skin and weight, but individual pets will have different dietary requirements. We advise getting the best quality within your budget, but don’t feel obliged to buy premium products unless there’s a medical reason why your pet needs to be fed a specific brand.

For dogs, look for a complete dry food that will meet all their nutritional needs – you don’t have to feed them a mixture of dry kibble and wet meat. If you can afford to, and have the storage space, buying in bulk will work out cheaper. It’s very easy to over-feed your pet which risks obesity, as well as being more expensive for you, so make sure you’re weighing out the right amount of food for your pet’s weight.

When it comes to treats and training aids for dogs, you can use dry kibble, small pieces of cheese or, my dog’s personal favourite, carrots! And if you’re struggling with the cost of pet food, please get in touch with Woodgreen or contact your local food bank for support.
Where can I buy affordable pet products?
You can buy lots of fantastic products second hand, or make them yourself. Check your local charity shops and Facebook Marketplace for things like pet beds, soft toys, dog coats, cat litter trays, scratching posts, appropriately sized small pet cages and enrichment items. Here at Woodgreen, our small pet accommodation is packed full of second-hand children’s toys like chairs and dolls’ houses, as well as household items like cardboard boxes and tubes, and they absolutely love exploring and chewing.

For dogs, an old duvet makes a very cosy bed, and a cereal box with kibble hidden in balls of newspaper provides hours of fun. You don’t need to go out and purchase pricey puzzle feeders and designer brands. Browse through our website or YouTube channel for more ideas on homemade enrichment – just get creative and have fun.
Are there any other low-cost services available to pet owners?
Getting help with a pet doesn’t need to be expensive. If you’re struggling with your pet’s behaviour, you can speak to one of Woodgreen’s qualified behaviourists for free – simply get in contact here. We also provide a number of free online events, including free Health &amp; Wellbeing Clinics, and low-cost puppy and adult dog training classes at our centre in Cambridgeshire.

For things like dog walkers and pet sitters, think about whether you could ‘buddy up’ with a trusted neighbour or local friend. Check your local community, as there may be groups that can support with dog walking.

For animal lovers who can’t commit to owning a pet, another option is to foster. At Woodgreen, we are always looking for volunteers to join us – and all expenses are paid for. For more information about fostering, head to our dedicated fostering page.         "
Why won’t my cat use the litter tray?,"




If your cat has started pooing and weeing around the home, you might be wondering why your cat won’t use the litter tray. Perhaps they’re no longer going outside or avoiding their tray altogether. Here we look at the reasons why your cat won’t use their litter tray and what you can do.
See your vet first
If you notice any changes in your cat’s behaviour or toileting patterns, arrange to see your vet so they can give a thorough check and make sure your cat is healthy.
Reasons why your cat may be avoiding their litter tray
If your cat is avoiding using their litter tray or only using it on occasion, here are a few things to check.

 	Is the litter tray clean? Make sure you regularly clean your cat’s litter tray between use. Many cats don’t like to use the same tray twice. If you have more than one cat, it’s best to provide one tray per cat and a spare. Place these in different areas of the home. This gives them greater choice of where to go to the toilet and a bit of privacy.
 	Where is the tray? The best place for your cat’s litter tray is in a quiet area of the home where your cat can easily get to it. Cats can be put off if they have to walk through high traffic areas of the house or past other pets.
 	Is the litter tray big enough? Make sure the litter tray is big enough for your cat to stand up, turn around and dig in.
 	Do you use scented litter? Avoid all types of scented litter or litter tray liners. Your cat is likely to avoid their tray as they can be put off by strong smells. Tray liners can disturb your cat while they’re using their litter tray because their claws can get caught on them.
 	Have you changed their litter recently? Cats prefer certain types of litter over others. A sudden change in litter might cause them to avoid using their tray. Sometimes it’s worth switching things up, but make sure you slowly wean them off their regular litter. Mix the new litter with their old type to begin with and then reduce the amount of the old litter.

Look out for certain behaviours
Sometimes cats will spray urine over vertical surfaces, known as ‘spraying’ or wee in several areas of the home known as squat marking. Other times, you might see your cat pooing in the middle of the garden and this is called middening.

These are all examples of scent marking behaviours. It’s a natural way for cats to protect their territory but they might also do this if they’re stressed or overwhelmed by changes in the home.  You might notice your cat marking their territory in doorways, windows, areas that smell strongly of their owner and high up spaces.

There are certain things that can trigger this behaviour so it’s important to identify the cause before helping your cat control their behaviour:

 	Not getting along with other pets in the home
 	Neighbouring pets
 	Children or a new arrival in the home
 	Building work in the home or sounds nearby
 	Changes in the home environment or owners' routine
 	Recent home-vet visit
 	Guests in the home

Cats use their scent to help them feel content and relaxed as well as send messages to other animals. If they are feeling unsettled or threatened, they will do whatever they can to help themselves feel better.
Changing your environment
By making a few simple changes to your home will help your cat to feel more settled in their environment. Try a few of these tips below and see if it helps solve your cat’s toileting issues.

 	Provide more hiding places and perches in high up areas. This will allow your cat to relax away from visitors and other pets if they wish to.
 	By simply moving your coffee table to the centre of the room will create separate pathways for your pet to use. This will allow them to stay hidden and comfortable. You can do this in the garden by placing flower pots and garden furniture around. This will give your cat areas to perch and hide.
 	Strategically place scratching posts and mats in areas such as doorways. This will allow them to scent mark in a different way. Just make sure all posts are sturdy and not going to wobble. Here are some things you can do about your cat’s scratching.
 	Try using Feliway or Pet Remedy. Both products are designed to help make your cat feel more relaxed and familiar with their environment.

How do cats mark their territory?,"




Cats mark their territory to feel calm and safe. They do this by leaving their scent in lots of ways. Cats will be seen rubbing against things, peeing around the home and sometimes pooping, or scratching furniture and carpets. This is a natural behaviour called scent-marking.

There are lots of ways a cat can mark their territory and several reasons why. Here we look at the different cat scent-marking behaviours including rubbing, scratching and inappropriate toileting, and what cats are trying to communicate.

Cats will scent mark their territory in different ways. Here are a few reasons why they do this:

 	To help them feel safe in their environment
 	To claim a familiar object or person
 	To communicate with other animals, making them aware of their presence.

Common cat scent-marking behaviours
Rubbing against furniture, walls – and you 

Does your cat rub against furniture and walls, or even headbutt you? This is their way of transferring their scent (natural pheromones) using scent glands in their face and head.

Cats will rub against things when happy, but also if they’re feeling a little unsure of their environment. You’ll see them displaying this rubbing behaviour in their core living area. It’s a way for them to feel relaxed and content. You might hear them purring away too.

You might also see a greasy brown mark where your cat has rubbed up against something. It’s best to avoid cleaning this off because it helps them feel safe in a familiar environment.
Urination and defecation
If you spot your cat pooing or weeing around the home, it won’t just be for no reason. We would first suggest seeking advice from your vet. This type of behaviour could be related to a medical issue that needs treating.

If you don’t already have a litter tray indoors, make sure it’s in a quiet area in the home that’s easy to access.
Toileting inside the home
If your cat is toileting in the home and not using the litter tray, they will be passing normal to large amounts of wee or poo. You might find them doing this in hidden, quiet, dark areas of the home and this should not be confused with scent-marking.

There are several reasons why your cat might dislike their litter tray. They may have developed a negative association with using it, or they might be worried by other pets in the home or neighbouring animals. Sometimes, changes to their indoor and outdoor environment might have an effect on them and other times, it could be that their tray is too clean or not clean enough. It’s important to consider different types of litters and liners, the location, size and more. Cats need to be comfortable and suit their needs.

However, there are times when cats will become stressed and scent mark in their home:
Scratching inside and outside the home
You will often see a cat scratching both in the house and outside. It is often seen as an undesirable behavioural trait, especially if your cat is scratching furniture or carpets. Good news is, there are things you can do about your cat's scratching behaviour and ways to deter them from scratching these places. Just make sure they have access to scratching posts, boards or carpet tiles around these areas.

Scratching is normal, healthy behaviour and It’s a natural part of a cat’s day-to-day life. They will do this to scent mark as well as condition their body and claws.

Cats will leave their scent from glands located between the pads of their paws and a visual mark will be left behind. You might see this along common routes in the house that your cat takes. Providing appropriate scratching items in these places will benefit your cat.

One of the best ways to stop a cat scratching furniture or carpets is by creating designated scratching areas. Just make sure it’s inviting enough. Try to encourage them to use it by sprinkling some catnip around the area. Or you can try placing interactive toys on or around the scratching post; a good toy for this is a wand. As your cat swipes for the toy, his claws will catch the surface of the scratching post and realise it feels good. Your cat will then return to the scratching post to use it again.

Squat marking - Owners may see their cats squat as if they’re going to the toilet, but the cat is only passing small amounts of pee each time. This can be a sign of a medical issue, but is also a way that cats will mark their territory. They will pass on signals to other cats and protect their territory with their scent.

Spraying - You might see your cat marking their territory by spraying. They will often stand up with their backs toward an object. Their tails will quiver and a spray of concentrated urine will be projected.

This is normal behaviour for a cat when it comes to them marking their territory outside. You’ll typically see them spraying against things, such as fence posts and bushes, to let other cats know it’s their home. Key areas you might find your cat showing this behaviour indoors, are around windows, doorways, areas that strongly smell of their owners and elevated .

Whilst unneutered male cats are more likely to mark their territory in this way, neutered male and female cats may also spray, especially if they are feeling vulnerable in their home.
Pooing in the home or the middle of the garden (middening)
Some cats might poop in the middle of the garden to deter other cats. This is a normal behaviour known as middening. It’s your cat’s way of sending a message to other felines in the area. If they’re feeling particularly insecure, your cat may start to poo in the home on elevated surfaces.
Peeing or pooping on bedding or clothing
Cats might pee or poop on items that smell strongly of their owner, including bedding and clothing. They will mark their territory here as a way of feeling closer to their owner and are likely to have separation issues.
What can you do about cats marking their territory?
Cat scent marking behaviours such as rubbing, scratching or weeing in the house should never be punished, as this is just your cat’s way of communicating.

Finding out the reason why your cat is displaying these behaviours can help to deter them or mark their territory in a more appropriate way.

Make sure your home has the following items to help your cat feel safe:

 	Litter trays
 	Feeding stations(separate from water station and litter trays)
 	Water stations
 	Areas to get up high
 	Hiding places
 	Scratching facilities
 	Toys

Cat flaps
Remember, a cat flap allows your cat to come and go as they please, but it also provides an open door to unexpected visitors. If another cat uses this cat flap, or stares through it, your feline friend can feel uneasy and insecure in their own home. This is when you might see your cat inappropriately scent marking in the home.

The best solution is to use a cat flap that works with your cat’s microchip. This will help keep other cats out of your home.

If you think your cat is marking their territory by spraying because another cat is outside, try blocking their view, particularly at ground level. Cats feel safer when they are higher up. You can do this by applying opaque film or tape over patio doors and transparent cat flaps.

Try placing a high vantage point inside the house. For example, a tall cat scratcher with a platform on top will allow your cat to view the potential intruder from high up, from the inside.

What should you feed your ducks and geese,"You should feed your ducks and geese a natural and varied diet of fresh grass, fruit and vegetables. This will help your feathered friends lead happy and healthy lives.
Ducks
Ducks enjoy spending a lot of time on the water sieving out tasty treats and food. They also enjoy being able to graze on grass especially when it has been raining and the grass is damp.

For their daily feed, provide your ducks with age appropriate floating duck pellets in a large tray of water. Do not place it in the pond area as this will cause the water to become mucky very quickly.

Feed your ducks fresh fruit and vegetables every day. Some firm favourites include: watermelon, peas, chopped dandelion leaves, sweet corn watercress, leafy greens and melon.
Geese
Geese should be free to graze on short grass all day. It makes up the main bulk of their diet. They particularly enjoy fresh grass shoots. If they have limited access to grass space, they can be topped up with some wheat. Make up 200g worth in a bucket of water every day and this should be sufficient.

Just like ducks, geese also enjoy fresh vegetables similar to what is listed above.  Make sure you provide a large bucket of fresh water suited to their height. Always try to protect the water from wild birds to reduce any risk of disease.          "
Ducks and Geese health - what to look out for,"Ensuring your ducks and geese are housed and fed correctly is the best way to prevent them from suffering ill health. Below are a few common diseases that you should be on the lookout for:
Duck enteritis
Duck enteritis is thought to be brought in by wild migrating birds and can be fatal to your whole flock if not spotted early. You should seek veterinary attention and treatment should be started promptly.

Common signs of enteritis include:

 	Loss of appetite
 	Bloody diarrhoea
 	Discharge from the nose and eyes
 	Sudden death

Coccidiosis
Coccidiosis is a parasite which can be brought in by wild water fowl or if the enclosure is over grazed by too many ducks or geese. Symptoms include:

 	Weight loss
 	General poor condition
 	Diarrhoea with mucus

If you suspect your pets have coccidiosis you will need to seek veterinary attention promptly as it can be fatal.

It’s worth having two areas you can rotate your ducks and geese between every few months. This will allow the ground to recover and any bacteria or parasites will subside. As these species spend a lot of time grazing and producing a lot of poo, the ground can harbour parasites and bacteria such as coccidiosis.
Angel Wing
Angel wing can be common in geese and ducks if they are being fed an inappropriate diet and receiving too much protein. Feeding bread has also been linked to this wing deformity.
Respiratory disease
Respiratory disease can be particularly common when ducks and geese are housed in large groups. The bacteria can be inhaled or picked up on the feet. Again, this can be fatal and needs prompt action from your waterfowl friendly vet. Signs to look out for include:

 	Lameness
 	Sneezing
 	Discharge from the nose and eyes
 	Twisted heads
 	General dullness and poor condition.

Worming
It is advised to worm your ducks and geese twice a year using flubendazole. Although they are not as prone to worms and mites as chickens, they can still be at risk so it’s worth preventing it.          "
An introduction to ducks and geese,"Ducks and Geese are confident birds and very loyal, which is why they make great pets. Once they get to know you, they’ll enjoy following you around and taking treats from your hand.

It’s important to remember however, like all pets, ducks and geese have specific care needs and can live to ten years old and even up to 20 years with some breeds of geese.

Check out the following fast facts which will provide you with some basic information to help you decide whether having ducks and geese as pets is right for you.
Fast Facts
Companionship

Ducks and geese need to live with at least three to four other companions, the best minimum mix is a mallard/gander to three females.

Life expectancy

Ducks live between five and ten years depending on breed, and geese can live anywhere between ten and 24 years.

Accommodation

Ducks need lots of space to keep them fit, healthy and happy. Things can get very messy if their enclosure is too small. Ducks and geese tend to be quite challenging when it comes to their bedtime routine. They don’t put themselves to bed like their feathered pals, chickens. They may need some encouragement to be shut in each night if there is a predator risk.

The minimum size shelter and enclosures should consist of:

 	A 3ft by 3ft (91cm by 91cm) shelter for 3-4 small breed ducks or 1 shelter/sleep section per duck if floating on a pond.
 	6ft by 4ft shelter/ark/shed for 3-4 geese or large breed ducks such as Muscovy. Geese and larger breed ducks need the height as well as extra space, as their necks tend to be quite tall.

Diet

Geese feed on grass. It’s their main source of food and must be provided with a bucket of water for them to drink from.

Ducks graze on grass but also feed on floating duck pellets in a large water filled feeder. They must also have a separate bucket of clean water to drink from.

Health

Ducks and geese are not as prone to worms and mites like chickens, but you should still worm them twice a year using flubendazole.

Your ducks and geese will naturally produce a lot of poo as they spend most of their time grazing. Because of this, the ground can become a breeding ground for harmful parasites and bacteria. You should rotate your ducks and geese between two grassy areas every few months for the ground to recover.

Angel wing can be common in geese and ducks if they are being fed an inappropriate diet and receiving too much protein. Feeding bread has also been linked to this wing deformity.

Respiratory disease is also a possibility in ducks and geese - good husbandry is key to keeping it at bay.

Family friendly

Ducks can make a lovely addition to any family with calm children. As long as they feel happy and content, you’ll find your ducks following you about in the hope for treats.

Geese are more suited to families with older children as they can be as tall as a small toddler. They can become quite territorial and could potentially cause harm to a human if appropriate care is not taken. Introductions to other family pets including cats and dogs should be slow and closely monitored.          "
How to house your ducks and geese,"When it comes to housing your ducks or geese, make sure you do lots of research to ensure your providing the right enclosure.

Invest in something that will last through the years and outstand various weathers. Ducks and geese can live for many years so it’s worth assessing if you’ll be able to provide the space they need long term.

The minimum size shelter and enclosures should be: 

 	3ft by 3ft (91cm by 91cm) shelter for 3-4 small breed ducks or 1 shelter/sleep section per duck if floating on a pond
 	6ft by 4ft shelter/ark/shed for 3-4 geese or large breed ducks such as Muscovy

Geese and larger breed ducks need the height as well as extra space, as their necks tend to be quite tall.

If you’re unable to keep free range ducks and geese, make sure you provide:

 	10ft long by 6ft wide enclosure for 3-4 small breed ducks such as Call Ducks
 	20ft by 20ft enclosure for geese or large breed ducks

For all breeds they will require a large children's hard plastic paddling pool or plastic garden pond to suit the recommended minimum group size.

If you are able to provide larger than the minimum size, then it’s worth investing in a large pond area. Just make sure it has easy access using slopes. Floating duck houses can be added if pond size allows, this is an excellent way of offering an extra safe sleeping area away from predators.

An enclosure the size of a small paddock is even better! This will allow your ducks and geese to move around freely. There’s less chance of disease build up too if they have lots of grassy areas to explore.

There are lots of duck and goose shelters available on the market, the bigger the better for this species. They prefer extra floor space as they don’t tend to roost up high.

 	Grass, builders' sand or pea shingle can be added around this area as a floor substrate, although be aware that small patches of grass are likely to be destroyed quickly.
 	Straw and large flake shavings make ideal bedding to place in the shelter for both ducks and geese. Make sure you clean up any poo in their enclosure every day and do a full clean and pond refresh weekly.

Remember that most goose breeds are tall and like to walk into the shelter together, so choosing a shelter with height is also important.

Here’s a list of suppliers who provide quality enclosures and shelters:

Quality and spacious coop providers include: 

 	Livestock Ark by Green Frog Designs
 	The Duck House by Solway Recycling
 	Haydock Goose and Duck House by Grandad Rob designs.

Quality and spacious run suppliers include:

 	runaboutruns.com
 	Grandad rob designs
 	Gardens and pets-uk ebay seller – metal walk in poultry runs

Ducks and geese are always at risk of predators such as foxes, cats and dogs. Making sure they’re safe and secure is essential.

Here are a few ways to keep your pet ducks and geese safe: 

 	Lock them away in a secure shelter at night, ensuring the unit has strong bolts that cannot be easily undone
 	Provide floating houses or an island in the middle of a large pond
 	Get some purpose made electric fencing
 	Provide an enclosure with a secure roof for small breeds with a high predator risk.

Companionship

Ducks and geese should always be housed in small groups with breeds of similar size especially if a large paddock area is not available. Ganders and mallards can be relentless to females especially during spring, therefore it is advisable to ensure there are at least 3-4 females to each male within the flock.          "
Your dog could die in a hot car,"You may be in a hurry, or the shop may not accept dogs.

However tempting it may be, never leave your dog in the car during summer months. The result could be fatal.
‘Not long’ is too long
Your car can become an oven very quickly even when it doesn’t feel that warm. When it’s 22°C outside, your car can reach an unbearable 47°C within an hour - leaving the window open simply won't keep your car cool enough.
Nobody thinks it'll happen to them
Nobody ever thinks it’s going to happen to them or their much-loved pet, yet every year many people still gamble with their dog’s life. Every summer, dogs die in hot cars.

It’s not OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm day, even if the windows are left open or you’ve parked in the shade. Even if the dog doesn’t die, they’ll experience severe distress, discomfort and anxiety.
Dog theft
It’s also important to be aware of opportunists who may be on the lookout for cars with their windows open on hot days. Dog theft from unattended cars has increased significantly in the past couple of years. If you know you’re not going to be able to keep an eye on your dog at all times, it may be safer for them to stay home.
What should you do if you see a dog in a car on a warm day?
First, you should assess the dog's wellbeing. If they're showing signs of distress or heatstroke call 999. The police will be best placed to know what to do. Sit tight and wait for them to come. As much as you might want to free the dog by breaking a window, you could get yourself into trouble.

Woodgreen work closely with the RSPCA who advise, ""Legally you can cause damage if you can be sure the car owner would consent if they knew the dog was in danger."" If you really need to, make sure you tell the police of your actions and take photos of the dog and contact details of any witnesses.          "
Ask the experts: A training guide for reactive dog owners," In an ideal world, we all hope for our dogs to be friendly, easy-going and comfortable in different environments. In reality, this just isn’t the case for all dogs, especially those who have quite an extreme response to everyday situations like seeing other dogs and people. This is what we call a ‘reactive’ dog and it’s very common, so you’re not alone! As one of Woodgreen’s qualified dog behaviourists, here are some questions Lindsay is regularly asked about reactive dogs:

&nbsp;
Why do dogs become reactive?
Dogs are usually reactive if they don’t have very good social skills and feel worried by other dogs and people, or if they’ve had a bad experience in the past which frightened them. Another thing we see is excited dogs that love people and other dogs a bit too much. They often get frustrated when they can’t go bounding over to say hello and play. These triggers cause a reaction which can differ for each dog.

For worried or frightened dogs, they trigger a ‘fight or flight’ response. If they’re on a lead, they can’t run away, so they defend themselves the only way they know how, by growling and barking. They’re telling the other dog or person to stay well away! Frustrated dogs respond by pulling on the lead, spinning or turning around and grabbing their owner to get rid of some of their energy.

In both cases, it’s a highly emotional state so you may find that your dog can’t listen to you or take treats while they’re trying to cope with the situation.

&nbsp;
How to train a reactive dog
At Woodgreen, we recommend three things:

 	Practice basic training

All dogs benefit from having a good recall and knowing simple cues like ‘sit’. This builds trust between you and your dog, and will make the bigger issues easier to tackle. Marker words like ‘good’, ‘yes’ or a clicker are powerful training tools. This will let your dog know instantly that they’re being praised and a treat is on the way. You can also work on calm behaviours throughout your day – teach them to wait for their food, settle down on cue and solve problems through enrichment (like Kongs and puzzle feeders).

 	Keep your dog away from triggers

Inevitably, we can’t control the outside world and don’t know who will come around the corner. The good news is, there are steps we can take to remove our dogs from stressful situations – especially during the training period. Try taking them for walks at quieter times of the day, like early in the morning, or take them out into the countryside or enclosed dog fields away from the hustle and bustle. Alternatively, walk your dog less and replace the activity with games or training in the garden.

If you reduce the opportunity for your dog to be reactive and increase their practice of alternative behaviours, it will be become second nature.

 	Teach them alternative behaviours

For times when your dog is confronted by a stressful situation, teach them to sit down (“sit!”), sniff out some treats on the floor (“find it!”) or turn away and walk in a different direction (“this way!”). All of these should be rewarded with something your dog finds motivating, like their favourite treats or a toy.

First, you should teach these cues while you’re at home before trying them out on a quiet and calm walk. Then gradually increase how close you can get to your dog’s triggers – but make sure you go at your dog’s pace. The more practice your dog has, the more they will associate their triggers with positive outcomes rather than stressful ones.

Have an open mind and be realistic about what your dog will be capable of. Fearful and long-term reactive dogs may never happily mix with groups of dogs – but you should be able to feel confident walking your dog calmly, without regular incidents. This would be a big win!

&nbsp;
What if something goes wrong?
It can be embarrassing when your dog causes a scene out in public, but it’s important to consider how your dog is feeling. They’re probably scared and need you to stick up for them. If you can see another person approaching you with a dog, it’s okay to keep your distance and ask them to stay away if you need to. Training is not a straight-forward process, your dog will need time and patience to develop these new skills and habits.

If you have a bad day, take a deep breath and head home, but don’t let it put you off. Take a break and go back to the basics with gusto. Any progress you’ve already made, you will be able to pick up again, so don’t give up! If you need help, Woodgreen’s team of behaviourists are on hand to provide free support – just get in touch.

How to care for your rabbits in hot weather,"Creating a cool environment for your rabbits will help them feel comfortable and happy. It’s a surefire way of protecting them from heat-related illnesses including heatstroke.

 	If you can, it’s worth moving outdoor enclosures including hutches and runs to a shaded part of your garden.
 	Create as much extra shade as you can throughout the day. You could put up a garden parasol over their outdoor enclosure, a gazebo or a white sheet.
 	Don’t forget the sun will move throughout the day so keep an eye on your rabbits to make sure they’re not exposed.
 	Make sure your rabbits’ enclosure has plenty of airflow to provide a nice breeze.
 	Ensure that the enclosure has plenty of airflow, and isn’t trapping in heat. If your rabbits are housed in a converted shed, large hutch or indoor room and it's safe to do so, it might be worth putting on a fan. Just make sure any wires are tucked away or covered using cable pipe protectors so your rabbits can’t nibble through them.
 	Replenishing your rabbits’ hutch with fresh, fluffy piles of hay will allow your rabbits to burrow inside to keep cool. It’s also worth covering tunnels so they don’t get too hot.
 	Keep your bunnies hydrated throughout the day with shallow bowls of fresh water and forage for them to munch.
 	Fill a couple of large trays with soil, rabbits love to have a dig, stretch out and cool off in soil. You could provide large card boxes with dig trays inside to act as a shaded burrow.
 	Summer weather brings an increase in flys! Try and keep them away by regularly cleaning out your rabbits’ enclosure. Removing poo will prevent flystrike.
 	Place bottles of frozen water or cold, damp tea towels around your enclosure. Your rabbits will enjoy laying beside them for some much-needed relief.
 	For long-haired rabbit breeds, keep their fur clipped short and move them inside to a cool room during the hottest parts of the day.

How to look after your dog’s teeth,"Just like us, dogs have two sets of teeth and once they get their adult teeth they need to be cleaned regularly to keep them healthy. Here we explain the problems of dental disease, how to keep your dog’s teeth healthy and top tips on how to safely clean their teeth.

Dental disease is very common and can affect any dog, especially small dogs, Greyhounds and Brachycephalic breeds. These dogs are more prone to dental problems because of the shape of their mouths.

What should you look out for?

Signs of tooth problems can include bad breath, a sudden reluctance to chew or pick up toys, eat their food, increased dribbling and rubbing their face on the floor or furniture. If you spot any of these signs, arrange to see a vet straight away. Diagnosing the problem quickly will reduce the risk of your dog experiencing pain and needing medical treatment.

Preventing dental disease

Some dog foods and other commercial dog treats often contain large amounts of sugar, which can lead to a build-up of plaque on the surface of your dogs’ teeth eventually causing gingivitis, an inflammation of the gums. Feeding your dog natural raw foods and allowing them to chew on suitable raw bones can help keep their teeth clean.

While the action of chewing on appropriate bones can help clean a dog’s teeth, the best way is to teach your dog to accept having their teeth cleaned with a soft toothbrush and dog friendly toothpaste. If your dog needs extra help with their teeth, there are lots of products and supplements on market including Plaque off and oral hygiene gels.

Vets recommend cleaning your dog’s teeth daily if possible, but at least every 2-3 days should be enough to keep their teeth clean. You can use a soft bristled child’s toothbrush, a doggy toothbrush that fits on your finger, or a double-ended brush specifically for dogs. Make sure the toothpaste you choose is safe for dogs to swallow, human toothpaste containing fluoride is not safe for dogs.

How to clean your dog’s teeth

The ideal time to start cleaning your dog’s teeth is when they’re a puppy. Teaching them at a young age will help to build their tolerance and it’ll become part of their routine. You can introduce older dogs to having their teeth cleaned, just ensure you take things slowly. You will need a soft brush and plenty of tasty treats.

 	Start by gently touching your puppy on the mouth and feed them a treat. The idea is to build this up very slowly so the puppy learns that having their mouth touched, opened and examined is not anything to worry about.
 	Introduce the doggy toothpaste by putting a little on your finger and allow your dog to lick some off. Do this a couple of times before repeating but this time, using a toothbrush when you’re ready. Many toothpastes are meat flavour, so they should enjoy this!
 	Then gently begin rubbing the toothpaste on your dog’s teeth with your finger, to get them used to this sensation.
 	The next step is to gently lift your dog’s lip, place the brush against their teeth and give them a reward.
 	You might like to talk your dog through this process so they know what’s coming next. Using key phrases each time like “I’m going to lift your lip” and “Here’s the toothbrush” etc can really help keep dogs calm.
 	Incorporate teeth cleaning into your daily or weekly dog care routine and your dog will have shiny, white, healthy teeth for years to come.

How to look after your cat's teeth,"It’s important to look after your cat’s teeth to prevent dental disease. Whilst it’s fairly common in older cats, younger cats are also at risk. Here are a few things to look out for, how to reduce your cat’s chances of getting it and how to manage the problem.

Preventing dental disease

When it comes to taking care of your cat’s teeth, diet is an important factor. Feeding your cat, the right foods will help prevent dental issues. Allowing your cat to eat kibble or something that rubs against their teeth can be an effective way of preventing a build-up of tartar and plaque. If you’re worried about your cat and their dental health, we would advise speaking to your vet who will be able to help.

Remember, cats get a lot of water from eating wet food, so a diet of both wet and dry is best if possible.

There are specific cat toothpastes and toothbrushes available on the market. But it’s important to consider your cat before your start brushing their teeth. Many cats will be confused if you approach them with a tooth brush and start brushing. For us, it’s a normal part of our routine, but not for cats. Try to making this a worry-free experience and take things slowly. Gradually introduce your cat to flavoured cat toothpastes by having them lick it off for fingers. Then over a few weeks, introduce a soft cat toothbrush and get them used to having the outside of their teeth brushed and their gums. Remember, your cat should always be the one to feel in control and you should stop the moment they show signs of wanting you to.

If you still need help, there are certain products on the market including ‘Plaque Off’ which can further help to prevent dental disease. We recommend you speaking to your vet if you’re thinking about trying a new product.

What should you look out for when it comes to caring for your cat’s teeth?

There are three main types of dental disease in cats. 

Gingivitis- Red, inflamed, sore gums – usually seen in a line where the tooth meets the gum.

This can caused by plaque and tartar, as well as viral diseases or in rare cases, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

Periodontal disease- When inflammation from gingivitis starts affecting the tissue that holds the tooth in its socket. This can lead to infections, abscesses and tooth loss.

Tooth resorption - Where the tooth starts wearing away. Similar to a cavity, usually at the gumline. The reason is unknown but it can happen to cats at a young age. It’s a very painful condition resulting in broken teeth.

Gingivostomatitis – A rare, but serious type of dental disease which is difficult to control. It causes extreme swelling of the gums and corners in the back of the mouth. Cats with this condition may need to have all their teeth out, or prescribed lifelong medication.

Cats are very shy, so when it comes to their teeth, they tend to hide dental disease. It can be tricky for you to spot something’s wrong until your vet points it out. Try to look out for your cat drooling, pawing at their mouth or refusing to eat certain types of food.

When to see a vet

Seek advice from your vet if you notice any of the following:

 	Change in eating pattern, wanting to eat but walking away or an inability to chew properly. Things will have to be very serious before they stop eating all together.
 	Sore gums
 	Bleeding gums or blood coming from the mouth
 	Change in grooming habits. E.g grooming less or not at all
 	Swelling around the mouth and jaw
 	Loose teeth
 	Bad breath
 	Change in temperament - pain can often lead to this
 	Excessive drooling.

Treatment

Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment can vary. It will usually involve a full clean and descale of the teeth under general anaesthetic by your vet. They might also take an x-ray to assess tooth root problems. In some cases, removal of teeth, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication will be prescribed.

After any type of dental work, it’s important to follow your vet’s advice on what type of food to give to your cat.

Top tip: You can always try soaking biscuits in a small amount of warm water to make them softer and easier to eat.

How to look after your rodent’s teeth,"Diet, lifestyle and environment are all important factors to consider when it comes to keeping your rodent’s teeth healthy.

Many small pets including chinchillas and degus are prone to dental problems. Unless they have inherited a disease from their parents, dental problems are usually down to poor diet or unsuitable environment.
Reducing the risk of dental disease in rodents
One of the best ways of keeping your chinchilla and degu’s teeth healthy and reducing the risk of dental disease is by providing a varied and natural diet with plenty to gnaw on.

In fact, around 85% of their diet should be made up of good quality hay, 5% should be pellet feed and 10% healthy forage.

Chinchillas and degus should be housed in a spacious enclosure. Chinchillas need plenty of room for their everyday activities including perching, dust bathing, foraging for food, gnawing on safe wood and running. Degus need space for climbing, digging, chewing and running. If a degu is seen regularly chewing on their bars, it could be an indication that the environment is not suitable.
Chinchillas and degus teeth
You will only be able to visibly see chinchillas and degu’s front set of teeth, known as the incisors. These should be dark orange in colour. And the top and bottom set should meet nicely at a good level and not angled.

If you spot any of the following signs, your chinchilla or degu could have dental problems.

 	One or both eyes weeping
 	Drooling
 	Playing with food but not eating it completely
 	Teeth become lighter in colour
 	Teeth appear to be growing apart or at an angle
 	Face appears swollen or abscess appears along jawline
 	Reduced faeces or size reduced
 	Matted fur on the inside of their front legs
 	Sudden weight loss

Make sure you contact your vet if you have any concerns.
Hamsters and gerbils teeth
Hamsters’ and gerbils’ teeth grow continuously through their lives and their diet should be as varied as possible with plenty of things for them to gnaw on, including safe fruit tree twigs.

Occasionally, hamsters and gerbils can suffer with overgrown incisors (the front teeth). This is more common in pets that have been bred poorly or have been involved in an accident where they may have fallen with an impact.

You should check their teeth regularly to make sure they remain a good length. They should be a light yellow colour, although they can be white when they’re very young.

Hamsters who chew their cage bars regularly can risk damaging their teeth, so you should try to prevent this behaviour. The best way is to provide a very spacious cage with lots of exciting activities including tunnels, fruit tree twigs and toys to chew, suitably sized wheels and scatter feeding. Changing their environment regularly will also help to keep them interested.
Rats and mice teeth
Rats and mice also have front teeth that will continuously grow. Mice should have yellow teeth while rats have orange-yellow teeth, which may get darker as they age.

Mice and rats will wear their teeth down naturally by grinding their teeth together, this is known as ‘bruxing’. Occasionally, both mice and rats can suffer with dental issues including overgrown incisors, like hamsters and gerbils. Again, this can be down to poor breeding or an accident.
Keeping an eye on your mice's teeth
If you spot any of these signs, your mouse could have dental problems:

 	Rapid weight loss
 	Eating less than they usually do
 	Unable to chew hard foods and only eating softer foods they’re given
 	Incisors are not symmetrical

What to look out for in rats 

 	Rapid weight loss
 	Eating less than they usually do
 	Unable to chew hard foods and only eating softer foods they’re given
 	Lumps along the lower jaw

For mice and rats, the following signs can indicate a number of things including damaged teeth, or food getting stuck, but often the cause can be unknown:

 	Lumps along the lower jaw
 	Abscesses on the side of their face
 	Swelling in or around the mouth
          "
How to look after your ferrets’ teeth,"Ferrets can be prone to dental decay, particularly if they’re fed a soft meat diet. Feeding your ferrets a good quality complete dry ferret food offers the abrasion to help reduce the build-up of plaque by shifting it off the teeth. This in turn can reduce the risk of your ferret getting dental disease.

It’s important to always keep an eye on your ferrets’ teeth from the age of three onwards and monitor any changes or signs of problems.

Look out for the following, it could be a sign of certain dental problems:

 	Infection
 	unpleasant breath
 	damaged, broken or discoloured teeth.

When you book your ferrets in with a vet for their yearly vaccinations, they will also do a thorough health check, including their teeth. Spotting signs of dental disease early on is easier to treat. Ferrets will sometimes require one or two dental procedures throughout their lifetime, but it helps keep them happy and healthy.

How to look after your guinea pig’s teeth,"When it comes to caring for your guinea pigs, it’s especially important to look after their teeth. Some guinea pigs can be more prone to dental problems than others.

What should you feed them

Feeding your guinea pigs the right diet is the best way of ensuring good dental health. Their diet should be made up of 85% hay. This should be a pile of hay the same size of them and they should eat this daily. Not only will this keep them in good health, it’s also great for helping to keep their teeth in good shape.

Guinea pigs should not be fed muesli mixes as they are high in sugar and can lead to dental problems. Instead, switch to feeding your guinea pigs an egg cup of pellets each per day. Providing them with fresh forage including apple and willow twigs, and giving them opportunities to graze on grass, will also help keep their teeth healthy.

Checking your guinea pig’s teeth

When giving your guinea pigs their weekly health check, take a good look at their front teeth or incisors. You’ll see two teeth at the top and two at the bottom – they should be white and smooth and clearly wearing against each other.

If your piggy is missing a tooth, notice that one or more are a lot longer, or they're wearing down at an angle, contact your guinea pig friendly vet.

How to look after your rabbits' teeth,"When it comes to caring for your rabbits, it’s especially important to look after their teeth. Feeding them the right diet is the best way of ensuring good dental health.

Poor dental health can be fatal for rabbits and it’s often because of an incorrect diet. Here we look at how to look after your rabbit’s teeth, what the early signs of dental disease are and how to reduce the risk.
Rabbit dental problems 
A rabbit’s diet should be 85% hay. If they don’t have enough to munch on, their teeth may elongate and begin to wear unevenly causing sharp ‘spurs’. These may cause ulcerations to the tongue or cheeks. The tooth roots can also break through the jaw bone or grow up into the eye sockets of the rabbit causing pain and abscesses.

Feeding your rabbits the right diet will dramatically reduce the risk and in some cases resolve very early symptoms.
What should you look out for?

 	One or both eyes weeping, or blocked tear ducts
 	Weight loss
 	Drooling
 	Mucky bottoms or regularly finding soft stools within the accommodation
 	Lumps/abscesses along the jawline
 	Lack of appetite
 	Fly strike (when flies lay their eggs on your rabbit, and those eggs hatch out into maggots)
 	Overgrown front teeth with matted fur wrapped around them

How to prevent dental issues 
It’s important to remember that a rabbit with perfect teeth can still develop dental issues later in their life. Monitor your rabbit closely for signs of problems and visit the vet at least twice a year for regular dental checks.
What to do if your rabbit has dental issues
Unfortunately, dental disease in rabbits is rarely treatable. It can lead to a potentially slow and painful end for your furry friend. To manage the issue, it may be kinder to put them to sleep sooner rather than later with the support of your vet.

How to care for your cat in the hot weather,"From creating extra shaded areas in the garden, to keeping their water topped up, we have lots of tips on how to care for your feline friend in hot weather.
Top tips 

 	Place lots of cat-friendly furniture in the garden to create shade for your cat.
 	Even cats can get sunburnt, keep an eye on sensitive ears and noses and apply a cat-friendly sunblock.
 	Keep your cat indoors between 11am and 3pm
 	Put out an extra bowl of water for your cat and make sure it’s topped up throughout the day.
 	Keep curtains closed during the day to keep rooms cooler. Use a fan to circulate the air.
 	Make sure you keep their food fresh and not left out in the heat as you may attract pesky flies.
 	Provide a cool mat for your cat to lay on if they wish. Alternatively, freeze bottles of water and wrap them in towels for your cat to lean or sleep against.

Keeping cool in the shade 
Some cats enjoy basking in the sun, but it’s always worth providing shaded spots for them to retreat too when things heat up. You can easily keep your cat cool by placing extra plant pots around your garden and cat-friendly plants.

If you have a shed or garage that your cat has access to, make sure you check then before locking up at night. Cats will often find outbuildings to relax in when they need shade.
Cats and sunburn 
Cats with white noses and ears can be affected by a condition called solar dermatitis. It causes the tips of the ears to go red and can be quite sore. If you’re worried about your cat, speak to your vet.

There are certain pet-friendly sun creams such as Filta Clear which can be applied to the tips of the ears and nose. For some furless breeds including the Sphynx cat, it’s best to keep them indoors during the hottest parts of the day.

Don’t be tempted to share your sun cream with your pets, ours includes chemicals which can be toxic to cats and dogs. If you can’t find the cat-safe sun cream, it’s okay to use a sunblock safe for babies and young children, just check the label and make sure it’s free from zinc oxides.
Keeping hydrated
Make sure your feline friend has access to fresh water and keep it topped up all day. Cats will tend to drink more in hot weather so it’s worth adding an extra water bowl. You might want to get a water fountain for the garden, your cat will enjoy a quick refreshment and some like playing in water.

How to care for small pets in the hot weather," Rabbits and guinea pigs 

 	If you can, it’s worth moving outdoor enclosures including hutches and runs to a shaded part of your garden.
 	Create as much extra shade as you can throughout the day. You could put up a garden parasol over their outdoor enclosure, a gazebo or a white sheet.
 	Don’t forget the sun will move throughout the day so keep an eye on them to make sure they’re not exposed.
 	Make sure their enclosure has plenty of airflow to provide a nice breeze.
 	If your rabbits or guinea pigs are housed in a converted shed, large hutch or indoor room and it’s safe to do so, it might be worth putting on a fan. Just make sure any wires are tucked away or covered using cable pipe protectors so they can’t nibble through them.
 	Replenishing your hutches with fresh, fluffy piles of hay will allow your rabbits and guinea pigs to burrow inside to keep cool. It’s also worth covering tunnels so they don’t get too hot.
 	Keep them hydrated throughout the day with shallow bowls of fresh water and forage for them to munch.
 	Place bottles of frozen water or cold, damp tea towels around your enclosure. They will enjoy lying beside them for some much-needed relief.

For rabbits 

 	Fill a couple of large trays with soil, rabbits love to have a dig, stretch out and cool off in soil. You could provide large card boxes with dig trays inside to act as a shaded burrow.
 	Summer weather brings an increase in flies! Try and keep them away by regularly cleaning out your rabbits’ enclosure. Removing poo will prevent flystrike.
 	For long-haired rabbit breeds, keep their fur clipped short and move them inside to a cool room during the hottest parts of the day.

Guinea pigs

 	Avoid using plastic igloo style hiding spaces as these can get very hot and will trap the heat. Instead, use large open-ended hiding spaces like wooden bendy bridges, or houses that have multiple entrances which will allow the hot air to move through.
 	Place a ceramic tile or two in their enclosure – it will remain cool in the heat and will give your guinea pigs the option of laying on or near it if they want to.

Chickens 

 	Provide shade over your chicken’s enclosure, you could put a large gazebo or parasol.
 	Large chickens, fluffy breeds and ex-caged hens can really suffer in extreme heat, so make sure you keep a close eye on them and offer as much protection as possible.
 	If you can, it might be worth moving your chicken’s coop and run to a cooler part of the garden.
 	Make sure there’s plenty of shallow water trays and bowls around their enclosure.
 	Chickens like dust bathing to keep themselves cool, make sure they have plenty of room in shaded areas to do this.
 	You can create more shade by placing plant pots and shrubs around their coop and run to create breeze and offer shade.
 	Pick up poo as often as you can to keep those flies at bay.
 	Let them out of there coop as early as possible when it’s cool, this will prevent them from overheating.

We hope these tips will help keep your furry and feathered friends cool and happy! For any other advice, visit our website or give us a call, we’re here for both pets and their people.         "
Ask the experts: A guide on getting a kitten," How do I know if a kitten is the right pet for me?
Like any pet, cats are a big commitment of time, money and effort – and they need to get on with any other pets and people living in the home. You should be prepared to give them everything they need for a bright future. If you already know what qualities you’d like in a cat (for example an affectionate lap cat or an independent hunter), you might want to rehome an adult who’s already developed their personality. Kittens need lots of socialising and regular meals, so bear in mind your lifestyle if you aren’t at home all day. If you decide that a kitten is right for you, be sure to use The Kitten Checklist by The Cat Group to help you find a healthy, friendly kitten from a reputable source.
How can I socialise my kitten?
The socialisation period covers a specific time of a kitten’s life between two and seven weeks old and should be continued in the first few weeks after you bring them home. To successful socialise your kitten, they should have pleasant interactions with different sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touches. Think of all the typical situations your kitten is likely to encounter in their life, and introduce them to as many things as possible to prevent issues in their adult lives. This includes getting them used to a cat carrier, travelling in the car, examinations, grooming, interacting with people and animals, loud household noises, as well as different textures and noisy packaging. The more positive experiences your kitten has, the more likely they are to grow into a well-rounded, confident adult cat.
How can I teach my kitten to play appropriately?
Every cat has a desire to hunt, it’s one of their natural instincts and some will be more keen than others. When a cat plays, they mimic the hunting sequence – eye, stalk, chase, catch and kill – this helps to satisfy their primal urges. When you have a kitten, it’s tempting to get them to chase your hands and feet by wiggling them. And this might be sweet when they’re tiny kittens, but encouraging this behaviour teaches them that you’re a toy and this could hurt when they get bigger!

A popular toy with our cats here at Woodgreen is feather wands including ’Da Bird Flying Purrsuit’. This helps a cat’s hunting instincts kick in, and they can pounce on the end to complete the hunting sequence. We also highly recommend the Kong Kickeroo, a small catnip toy that cats love to hold in their front paws and kick with their back paws. This is another important part of play to help get all their energy out, and leave them feeling satisfied.

Never use laser pens when playing with your cat. As much as they might enjoy chasing the light, they can’t physically catch it which can be frustrating for them. In some cases, it can lead to behavioural issues like attacking owners after a play session, or becoming obsessed with chasing light around the house.
How can I get my home ready for a kitten?
When you first bring a kitten home, keep them in a quiet room or designated area with plenty of food, water and toys, as well as their litter tray, scratching post and a cosy spot for sleeping. Once your kitten is consistently using the litter tray, you can gradually expand the area they’re allowed to roam. Cats are very sensitive to their environment, so keep their litter tray in a quiet, easily accessible place away from anything noisy like the television or washing machine.

Cats like to scratch things to keep their claws in good condition, but also as a way of marking their scent in their favourite rooms. It’s a good idea to have scratching posts near the entrance and exits to places where they spend a lot of time. As cats love to get up high and hide away, make sure your kitten has somewhere they can relax without being interrupted by children or other pets. If you have more than one cat in the home, each cat will need their own separate resources.
When can I let my kitten outdoors?
Letting your kitten outdoors for the first time can be daunting, but it’s vital for their wellbeing as they can explore and display natural behaviours. Before you do so however, make sure they’re microchipped, fully vaccinated and neutered to prevent any unexpected litters. If you’ve rehomed your kitten from a pets charity like Woodgreen, they should have already had these procedures and be ready to go!

To help your kitten adjust to the outside world, and make sure they return safely, start preparing a few weeks in advance. Feed them around the same time each day so they learn to expect food at certain times. When you’re preparing it, make a sound, call ‘dinner’, whistle or rattle a food tin. This way, your kitten will associate the sound with food and know it’s on the way. Let them out for the first time shortly before their mealtime, as they will be more keen to return home when they hear a familiar sound.

Choose a calm, quiet day without heavy rain, strong winds or lots of people in the garden. This could be scary or overwhelming for your kitten, and may put them off going outside again. Make sure there are places for your kitten to explore and hide behind, like potted plants near the back door. After a few trips outside, they will start to feel more comfortable in their surroundings, and you’ll be more confident letting them out to explore!

We don’t recommend putting your kitten on a harness and lead, as it takes away their natural flight response and can cause them to feel anxious. Your cat should just wear a collar with a safety release mechanism, as it will come off without causing injuries if it gets caught on something.
Should I neuter my kitten?
Yes, we always recommend neutering your kitten(s) as early as possible. There are lots of benefits both for you and your kitten, and it’s a myth that female cats should have at least one litter. Cats can fall pregnant as early as four months old, and siblings do mate with each other. Cats can get pregnant again immediately after giving birth, meaning one female cat can be responsible for up to 20,000 kittens over five years!

As well as helping to control the cat population, neutering can help keep cats healthy and safe. Un-neutered females will call and attract males who often travel across large areas. This puts them at greater risk of getting into road traffic accidents and fights with competing males, causing injuries and the spread of disease. Female cats who are not neutered are also at risk of contracting diseases during mating or suffering from pyometra, a potentially fatal womb infection. The up-front cost of neutering your cat outweighs the cost and risks associated with not neutering them. Woodgreen may be able to help with the cost of neutering – just get in touch to find out more.

Ask the experts: A guide for puppy owners," Where should I keep my puppy overnight?
Dogs are a social species with a similar range of emotions to us. When you first bring a puppy home, don’t shut them away by themselves overnight as they’re likely to be very scared and cry for reassurance. Puppies won’t have been taught that it’s okay to be alone and shutting them away will feel like a punishment.

Remember, company makes for a contented puppy. So for the first few nights, your puppy should sleep where you sleep. This can either be in your bedroom, or you could camp downstairs with them if you prefer. Our advice is to keep them in a puppy play pen to give them a secure, cosy space. They’re likely to sleep much better knowing their most trusted person is nearby, giving you a better night’s sleep too. You can then gradually wean yourself away at night when they’re not as scared.
What are your tips for house training?
For most dogs, house training is relatively straightforward. Consistency is key. Your puppy is likely to need the toilet after eating and sleeping, so encourage them out into the garden after every meal and nap (even if they’ve only been asleep for 10 minutes!). Look out for them sniffing, circling or wandering towards the back door as this could mean they need to go. If you’re struggling, keep a toilet diary. This will help you predict when they might need the toilet, so you can make sure your puppy is in the right place at the right time.

We wouldn’t recommend puppy pads, we find this teaches them it’s okay to toilet indoors and it adds another step into the process. Puppies associate where they’re standing with where they go to the toilet, this is called ‘substrate association’. For example, we want our dogs to know that they have to stand on the grass to go to the toilet. Since puppy pads were introduced, we’ve heard of more dogs toileting on soft surfaces like rugs and duvets. This isn’t ideal, but remember you should never punish a puppy for going to the toilet, regardless of where it is.
Should I crate train my puppy?
At Woodgreen, we’re big supporters of crate training! It can be extremely valuable to have a dog who is comfortable in a crate. This can be very useful when travelling in the car, or if they need to stay at the vets. Don’t feel like this has to be done as soon as you bring your puppy home. There’s no pressure – start when the time is right for you and your puppy.
How important is socialisation?
Socialisation is key to a puppy’s development, but introductions should be slow and calm. You should always be on your guard if people approach your puppy to say hello. For shy puppies in particular, spontaneous attention from strangers could make your dog fearful of others later in their life. Confident puppies on the other hand may lavish all the fuss, and your dog may end up being more interested in other people than you.

You should teach your puppy to accept things they may encounter outside including traffic and livestock. This is called ‘habituation’ and it’s just as important as socialisation. It’s a good idea to habituate your puppy to other dogs and people too, that way they’ll know to check in with you for a treat rather than chasing after everyone and everything.
What should I do about puppy mouthing and biting?
Puppies have sharp little gnashers and since they explore the world through their mouth, it can be quite tricky for owners. Mouthing is very normal and puppies do grow out of it. Keep offering them plenty of toys and they’ll soon learn there are more appropriate things to take their frustration out on. Make sure there’s always a reward for them when they get it right.

If distraction isn’t working, leave them in the room or take them to their puppy pen for a minute or two. This will let them know you won’t play when they’re behaving that way. For the ankle biters who grab slippers or tug on trouser legs, we advise owners to wear house wellies – yes really! This way your puppy won’t be able to hurt you, so stand perfectly still and they’ll soon realise that it’s boring.

The most challenging time for mouthing is the week or two before their final vaccination. By this point, they will have got used to your house and might need something new to keep them excited. Now’s a good time to start training and introduce them to scent games. From around 12 weeks when they’re teething, try giving them some frozen carrots and frozen rubber toys to soothe their inflamed gums. You can also freeze a knotted flannel or tea towel for them to chew.
How can I stop destructive behaviour?
Puppies chew. It’s what they do! So it’s a case of preventing them from grabbing things in their reach. It’s a good idea to have a tidy up and puppy-proof your home. If you have children, ask them to crawl around at your puppy’s level and move things that might be in their line of sight. Keep all valuable items out of reach, especially when they’re training and make sure you don’t leave any potentially harmful foods on the coffee table like grapes or chocolate. If like me you’re not a naturally tidy person, one of my tricks is to ‘hidey up’ rather than tidy up – keep a lidded plastic box in every room and pop any loose items in there.

During times when you can’t keep an eye on your puppy, keep them inside a puppy pen with an open crate, water, some toys and enrichment feeders to keep them busy. We recommend Kongs, LickiMats or homemade alternatives like stuffed toilet roll tubes. Your puppy will be able to see you while you get on with what you need to. And you’ll know they’re safe. It’s worth rotating their toys to keep them interested - puppies can get bored very quickly.
How can I teach my puppy not to guard things?
The trick is to add, never take away. By taking your dog’s food bowl away and giving it straight back, you’re likely to upset them. A good idea is to put half of your puppy’s food in the bowl, then call their name as they’re eating and add more to the bowl. They will learn that when a hand comes down, more food comes and there’s nothing to be wary of.

Puppies are likely to steal items from around the house too. Even if you’re tidy, they’ll get hold of something like a sock or a dropped tissue. If you react loudly and chase them to get the item back, they’ll think that’s a game. You might get away with taking things out of a puppy’s mouth, but when they’re a bit older they’re likely to tell you to stop. If the item they’ve stolen is completely harmless, like a tissue, ignore it and don’t add any value to it. If it’s something you need to get back, swap it with something better like a toy or a treat.
Why does my puppy go wild in the evening?
It’s very common for puppies to get the ‘zoomies’, or have a ‘mad half an hour’, usually later in the day after they’ve eaten. Some people find this quite worrying, as their angelic puppy is now a whirlwind of energy, ricocheting off the furniture and nipping their ankles! In most cases, it’s caused by having excess energy or being over-stimulated. They will usually tire themselves out quite quickly, and they should grow out of it.
How can I train my puppy to travel well in the car?
For many puppies, their first experience in the car will be leaving the breeder and going home, followed by trips to the vets for their vaccinations. If this is the case, they might associate the car with stressful or painful things. Take it slowly, with short trips to fun places – like driving to the local park for a gentle walk. Start with your puppy in the front of the car as it’s more stable, and they’re less likely to be bounced around. Seeing scenery whizzing by can make dogs feel travel sick, so a covered and secured crate can make them feel more settled. Legally, your dog has to be safely restrained in the car.

Ask the experts: An introduction to rabbit accommodation," We’re part of the coalition of experts behind Rabbit Awareness Week, an annual rabbit welfare campaign which aims to improve the lives of pet rabbits. Here are some common questions around the theme ‘creating a great environment for our long-eared friends’.
What’s the ideal housing set-up for a rabbit?
Rabbits need enough space to jump, binky (the adorable leap and twist they do when they’re happy), explore their surroundings, stretch up to their full height (or full length when laying down) and forage for food. The more room, the better! Rabbits don’t like being picked up and cuddled, so having a large enclosure means you can sit with your rabbits and enjoy their company. They will enjoy yours too as they hop over to say hello.

Outdoor pet rabbits should have access to a secure, predator-proof enclosure that measures at least three metres by two metres and one metre in height. A hutch or converted shed attached to a run works really well. Rabbits are crepuscular, which means they’re most active at dawn and dusk, so it’s important they have 24-hour access to their whole space.

Indoor rabbits need just as much space, for example in a converted bunny-proofed room. It should have natural light and a steady, comfortable temperature, with a baby gate so they can see out. Slippery floors can be dangerous, so lay carpets or rugs to keep your rabbits safe. Be prepared for lots of chewing, droppings and urine stains on flooring!
What should I put inside my rabbits’ enclosure?
Rabbits like to graze, dig, jump, hide and gnaw. These natural behaviours should be encouraged, so make sure you provide lots of hay and/or grass around their enclosure. It’s also worth having a few filled litter trays because rabbits tend to eat and go to the toilet at the same time. You can also fill litter trays or shallow cardboard boxes with play sand or organic soil so your rabbit can dig. It’s really enjoyable to watch!

Sturdy items like old furniture or children’s plastic chairs are great for them to jump on – just pop a blanket or towel on the top to provide some grip. As a prey species, rabbits need lots of places to hide, like open cat carriers and large cardboard boxes with rabbit-sized holes cut into them. Rabbits also have to chew to keep their teeth in good condition, so we recommend safe wood like apple or willow tree branches.
What should I do if my rabbit housing is too small?
If you’ve realised that your rabbit housing is too small, don’t despair! It can be quite pricey to completely replace what you already have, so consider extending their outdoor space by building or attaching a secure wooden-framed run to their existing enclosure. If you fancy a project, you could try converting a wooden shed or Wendy house, if you have one. You can then provide access to an outdoor run through a hole, or a secure tubing system if there isn’t room to have them side-by-side.
How many rabbits should I keep?
Rabbits are a very social species who live in groups in the wild, which helps them to feel safe. Even at home, rabbits should always live with at least one rabbit companion. The best pairing is a neutered male and neutered female, although same-sex sibling pairs can work if they’re neutered early to prevent fighting – ideally between three and six months of age.

If you have a single rabbit and would like to find them a companion, introducing them to other rabbits can be tricky. Just like humans, it can take bunnies a few tries to find their soulmate! At Woodgreen, we have a mixing service to find your rabbit’s perfect match, or we can offer advice on mixing at home.

Converting a shed for guinea pigs,"Small pets like guinea pigs need lots of space to explore and it needs to be secure too.

Converting sheds or Wendy houses are a great way of upgrading your guinea pigs’ accommodation, providing them with shelter and lots of space. Before moving your pet guinea pigs into a new enclosure like a shed, there are a few essential home improvements to make sure they are kept safe.

First of all, you need to make sure the shed or Wendy house you want to convert is in good condition with no gaps, rotting or snapped wood. You might even need to consider moving the shed or Wendy house from its current position onto a hard-standing surface. This will make sure your guinea pigs can’t chew and burrow under, as well as protect them from predators who might be able to dig their way in.
Installing locks
If you haven’t got one already, it’s worth installing locks to further ensure your guinea pigs stay safe and secure. Here are some suitable options:

 	Place two bolts on the outside – one at the top and one at that bottom. This will ensure that there is no danger of your guinea pigs being able to push out and escape.
 	Use sliding bolts on the outside of the door to keep it in place and secure.
 	Swivel latches should not be used as children and predators can easily open these.

[caption id=""attachment_6084"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Sliding bolt &amp; padlock on shed door[/caption]
Providing ventilation
Ventilation will ensure good air flow through the accommodation all year round. This is key to help prevent any respiratory illnesses. Wooden sheds retain heat so insuring good air flow will help keep your guinea pigs cool in the summer months.

[caption id=""attachment_6085"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""374""] Window ventilation on a shed[/caption]

Here are a few tips to help:

 	Windows should be replaced and covered with small gauge welded mesh attached to the inside of the frame. Chicken wire is not suitable – predators can easily get through it.
 	Create a wooden framed inner mesh door, using small gauge welded mesh. This allows you to leave the main shed or Wendy house door open throughout the day during the summer, without risk of your pets getting out or predators getting in.
 	Or, create a stable door with an inner mesh door – Cutting your main outside shed or Wendy house door through the middle will create a stable type door. That way you can keep the bottom half closed and insert an inner mesh door for the top part. You can then leave the top open all day without the risk your guinea pigs escaping or predators like cats and foxes getting in.

[caption id=""attachment_6086"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""372""] Inner door on a guinea pig wendy house[/caption]
Adding insulation
It’s worth lining the walls of your wooden shed or Wendy house to help keep your guinea pigs warm in the winter months. The best thing to do is use large sheets of wood or plywood with insulation in between. This will also prevent your pet guinea pigs from nibbling through the walls.
Stopping escapees!
Some pet guinea pigs like scurrying over to see their owners, especially when food is around. To prevent them from escaping when you want to go in to see them, there’s a simple solution. Just create a step over barrier by securing to the inside of the shed and their run across the bottom of the door frame. This gives you a golden opportunity to get in without your guinea pigs escaping.
Flooring
Lining the floor of the shed or Wendy house with lino will make cleaning an easier task. You’ll also increase the longevity as lino helps to prevent the floor rotting from urine.
Connecting a run and large enclosure
It’s worth connecting a secure run to your shed or Wendy house. This will help to keep your guinea pigs happy and secure while accessing two areas.

[caption id=""attachment_6087"" align=""alignnone"" width=""373""] Tunnel connecting wendy house and run[/caption]

Here are a few tips on what you can do:

 	Install a tubing or tunnel system. Visit RunAround for inspiration.
 	Attach the run directly onto the shed using wood screws or place the accommodation within the run with a pop hole between the two. You can then close the hatch on this to prevent your guinea pigs accessing the run overnight and open it again in the morning. Make sure the pop hole is big enough for your guinea pigs to easily walk through.

Converting a shed for rabbits,"Converting sheds or Wendy houses are a great way of providing a large sheltered enclosure for small pets like rabbits to use. They might be well suited to families who want to socialise with their small pets in comfort while being protected from wet or cold weather. If this is something you’re considering, you must first ensure they are suitable to be used for housing. They will need some improvements to make sure there’s sufficient ventilation, while keeping your rabbits safe and secure from any potential predators.

Before you start your project of converting a shed for rabbits, make sure it’s structurally sound, with no gaps, holes or rotting wood. The shed or Wendy house will also need to be placed on a hard-standing surface. Alternatively, you’ll need to install a solid floor to prevent your rabbits from digging and chewing. It will also provide a secure base so that predators like foxes can’t find their way in by digging.

&nbsp;
Installing locks
Another upgrade to consider when converting a shed for rabbits is suitable locks. Installing locks will further ensure your rabbits stay safe and secure. Here are a few recommendations:

 	Use sliding bolts on the outside of the door to keep it in place and secure.
 	Place two bolts on the outside – one at the top and one at that bottom. This will ensure that there is no danger of any animals being able to push out and escape.
 	Swivel latches should not be used as children and also predators can easily open these.

&nbsp;
Providing fresh air
If you’re thinking about converting your shed for your rabbits’ accommodation, make sure it’s well ventilated to ensure a good flow of air throughout the year. This will help to prevent respiratory illnesses. Wooden sheds and wendy houses get very hot in the summer months, so having good ventilation can help in circulating this air.

[caption id=""attachment_6085"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""374""] Window ventilation on a shed[/caption]

Here are some things you can do:

 	Windows - replace any windows with small gauge welded mesh, attaching it to the inside of the window frame. Chicken wire is not suitable – predators can easily get through it and rabbits can chew through it.
 	Inner mesh door – Create a wooden framed inner mesh door, using small gauge welded mesh. This allows you to leave the main shed or Wendy house door open throughout the day during the summer, without risk of your pets getting out or predators getting in.
 	Or, create a stable door with an inner mesh door – Cut your main outside shed or Wendy house door along the middle to create a stable type door. This will allow you to keep the bottom section closed, whilst creating a wooden framed inner mesh door for the top half. You can then leave the top half of the main shed door open throughout the day without risk of your pets getting out or predators getting in.

[caption id=""attachment_6090"" align=""alignnone"" width=""373""] Rabbit wendy house inner door[/caption]

Adding insulation
To help keep your rabbits cosy in the winter months, it’s worth lining the walls of your shed or Wendy house with large sheets of wood or plywood with insulation in between. This will also prevent your pet rabbits from chewing the walls.

&nbsp;
Stopping escapees!
Inevitably, pet rabbits will want to hop over to greet us at the door, and this can be tricky especially if you want to go in without them escaping. A simple and easy solution is to create a step over barrier. Secure this on the inside of the shed and their run across the bottom of the door frame – it will allow you enough time to get in and shut the door behind you to help prevent your rabbits from getting out.

&nbsp;
Flooring
It is always a good idea to line the floor of the shed or Wendy house with something like lino – this will make it much easier to clean and prevent the floor from become urine stained and rotting.

&nbsp;
Connecting a run and large enclosure
Connecting your shed or wendy house to a secure run is a great way of allowing your rabbits to safely and happily access two areas.

[caption id=""attachment_6087"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Tunnel connecting wendy house and run[/caption]

There are a number of ways you can do this:

 	Connect them using a tubing or tunnel system. Visit RunAround for inspiration.

Converting a shed for ferrets,"When converting a shed or wendy house for a pair of ferrets, you will first need to make a few adaptions to keep them safe. Inspect the wood shed or wendy house, is it strong and secure? Make sure there’s no rotting wood or gaps in the walls, this will protect your ferrets in case they want to plan a great escape!

Next, make sure the area is on a sturdy ground with a solid floor. This can be either concrete or wood. This will prevent your ferrets from gnawing or tunnelling under, and predators from getting in.
Installing locks
Locks on a shed will further ensure your ferrets are safe and secure in their home. Here are some recommendations:

 	Sliding bolts on the outside of the door
 	Two secure bolts on the outside – one at the top and one at that bottom
 	Swivel latches should not be used as children and predators can easily open these.

[caption id=""attachment_6084"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Sliding bolt &amp; padlock on shed door[/caption]
Providing ventilation
In the height of summer, wooden sheds and wendy houses can get very hot, so it’s important to keep your ferrets’ converted accommodation well ventilated. This will ensure good air flow and not only prevent respiratory illnesses, but it will also keep them cool in the summer months.

[caption id=""attachment_6085"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""374""] Window ventilation on a shed[/caption]

 	Replace glass or plastic windows with small gauge welded mesh attached to the inside of the frame. Chicken wire is too weak and will be an easy escape for your ferrets! 
 	Create a stable door with an inner mesh door by cutting your main outside shed or wendy house through the middle. This will allow you to keep the bottom section closed, while creating a wooden framed inner mesh door for the top half. That way, you can leave the top half open throughout the day without your sneaky ferrets being able to escape while stopping predators getting in. 

[caption id=""attachment_6214"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Ferret aviary double door system + step over barriers[/caption]

 	Use small gauge, strong welded mesh for an inner door. The mesh should be nailed or heavy-duty stapled on a sturdy wooden frame to prevent the ferrets from forcing the mesh from the framework.

Adding insulation
A ferrets’ enclosure should maintain a natural temperature year-round, as well as being sensitive to hot weather, they also feel the cold. Lining your wooden shed with insulation is a great way of keeping them cosy in the cool months. Just ensure the lining is between the large sheets of wood or plywood. This will further prevent your ferrets from biting their way out.
Stopping escapees!
Some pets like ferrets enjoy scurrying out of their enclosure at any given opportunity. You will need a solid barrier secured on the inside of the shed door to prevent a great escape. This should be at least three feet high. Alternatively, installing a double-door system will allow you to walk into a small corridor area, shut the main door behind you and then open the second door to go in with the ferrets.
Flooring
Good flooring in your ferrets’ house will further provide good insulation and safety. Lining the floor with lino or vinyl will be much easier to clean.
Connecting a run and large enclosure
It’s very important that your ferrets have plenty of space to avoid health issues such as obesity or joint mobility problems. Connecting a secure run to your converted shed or wendy house will allow your ferrets to explore 24 hours a day.

[caption id=""attachment_6087"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Tunnel connecting wendy house and run[/caption]

You can install pipes and tubes for running through or linking to a different part of the enclosure. Visit RunAround for inspiration.

Another option is securely fasten the run to the shed using suitable wood screws, or place the shed within a secure aviary. You can then create holes to allow your ferrets to easily move between two areas. Just ensure this is big enough for your ferrets to fit through.

Converting a shed for poultry,"As well as needing a secure run or free-range space in the daytime, your poultry will need somewhere safe and secure to go when it’s time to lay or go to sleep. But before moving them into the old garden shed, it’s worth upgrading to ensure they stay safe and happy.

Check the overall structure of the shed or wendy house and make sure it’s sturdy and secure with no gaps or damaged wood. You might need to consider moving the shed to an area with a solid floor. This will help prevent any predators like foxes digging their way inside the house.
Installing locks
Make sure all doors, lids and any nest boxes have secure locks on the outside to make sure they’re safe from predators at night and children who might want to let them out in the day.

 	Two secure bolts on the outside – one at the top and bottom
 	Sliding bolts on the outside of the door rather than swivel latches

[caption id=""attachment_6084"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""373""] Sliding bolt &amp; padlock on shed door[/caption]
Ventilation
It’s no surprise that wooden sheds get hot in the summer months. Make sure your converted shed has plenty of ventilation to help circulate air and keep things fresh. Good ventilation will help prevent respiratory illnesses. Here are a few tips to help:

 	If the shed you wish to convert has windows, these should be replaced with small gauge welded mesh attached to the inside of the window frame. Chicken wire is not suitable as predators can easily get through it. 
 	Also using small gauge welded mesh, it’s worth creating a wooden framed inner mesh door. This will allow you to leave the main shed or wendy house door open throughout the day to create air flow during the summer, without risk of your poultry escaping or predators like foxes or stoats getting in.

[caption id=""attachment_6085"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""374""] Window ventilation on a shed[/caption]
Insulation
To help keep your pets cosy in the winter months, it is worth lining the walls of your shed or wendy house with large sheets of wood or plywood. You can then place some insulation in-between this and the shed walls.
Stopping escapees!
Poultry can be loyal pets, they like the company of their humans and will be very excited to go over and say hello, especially if there’s some delicious grub on offer. To prevent them from getting too excited and escaping when you see them, it’s worth creating a step over barrier across the base of the door frame. This will allow you to go in and see them before they get the chance to get out.
Flooring
It is always a good idea to line the floor of the shed or wendy house with something like lino – this will help in making it easier to keep clean.
Connecting a run and large enclosure
Connecting your converted shed to a secure run is a great way of allowing your poultry access to areas. Here are a few things you can do:

 	Attach the run directly onto the shed or wendy house using the correct wood screws, and create a pop hole between the shed and run. Just make sure it’s big enough for your poultry to get through. You can close off access overnight and open it in the morning.
 	Position the shed in a secure aviary and create a pop hole in the shed big enough for your poultry to access. This can be locked up at night.

Ask the experts: Pet vaccinations - everything you need to know," Vaccinations are a very important part of pet ownership. Making sure your furry friends are up to date with their vaccinations is one of the best ways of protecting them from infectious diseases.

During lockdown, pet owners had limited access to non-essential veterinary care and now we’re facing a cost of living crisis which is putting a financial strain on owners which means pets don’t have the immunity they need.
Why should I get my pets vaccinated? 
Both pets and people are at risk of catching infectious diseases and the symptoms can either be mild or in some instances, life-threatening. The good news is that vaccines are there to prevent or reduce the risk of disease, helping our pets to live healthy and fulfilling lives.

A pet that’s been vaccinated is more likely to be protected from diseases that could make them seriously ill or be fatal. It’ll save you a costly bill from the vets to treat and will prevent the disease being passed onto humans. Preventing illness through vaccinations is cheaper, easier and safer than treating symptoms and potentially compromising our pets’ health.
Which pets need vaccinating?
The majority of dogs, cats and rabbits all need vaccinations as these pets all come into contact with other pets or are exposed to outdoor environments. The UK pet population is much higher than it was a couple of years ago, and therefore more likely to come into contact with other pets and risk catching something nasty. Even if your pet doesn’t go outside, it’s worth knowing that we can carry diseases indoors and transfer them to our pets.
When do pets need vaccinating?
The ideal time to get your pets vaccinated is when they’re young. This will give them the best chance of immunity. Young pets are most vulnerable to diseases, so early vaccination helps them to build better immunity for the rest of their lives. Typically, cats and dogs are vaccinated at around eight weeks of age, and rabbits from four weeks old.

Most pets will then need yearly boosters to top up their immunity. To find out the best schedule for your pet based on their species, age and vaccination history, get in touch with your vet.
How much does it cost to vaccinate pets?
For puppies and kittens, their first course of vaccinations costs around £75, with annual boosters coming in slightly cheaper. We recommend contacting your vet to discuss costs, as many offer payment plans that allow you to spread the cost. Just remember, vaccinations will always cost less than treating a sick pet.
What if I can’t afford to vaccinate my pets?
We highly recommend shopping around for a vet that suits your budget. You can be registered with more than one vet, so it’s worth speaking to your local practice about the different options available. Make sure to ask about available payment options and preventative healthcare plans. When thinking about getting a new pet, please factor in the cost of vaccination and other preventative treatments (like flea and worming) to protect your pets, and also your wallets in the long run.

Dog ‘trick or treat’,"Trick or Treat! 
Using tasty treats as a reward, teach your dog a new trick, perhaps 'roll over', 'high five' with a paw, weaving through your legs, or maybe something suitably spooky - like 'playing dead'. Dogs love learning and will have the best Halloween ever if you spend time teaching him or her something new. 
Step-by-step 
When training, break each exercise down into tiny steps. For most tricks, you can lure the behaviour by holding a treat just in front of their nose and luring them into the position you need them to move to. Remember to reward with the treat the moment your dog gets the right position. Keep your sessions short - if your dog is really keen, you could do try to four five minute sessions, progressing the same trick in one evening. 
Dog tricks you can try 
Here's a few dog tricks you can get started with, while our do-it-yourself dog training classes also help you to train your pooch in the comfort of their own home.

Services for your dog – dog daycare,"Dog daycare is somewhere you can drop your dog off for all or part of the day and pick them up later so they don’t have to stay overnight. Some boarding kennels and home boarders offer day care as well as overnight boarding. And most establishments advertised as doggy day care provide an area for a group of unfamiliar dogs to stay.
Check where your dog will be during the day
Most dog daycare services have large areas so the dogs can get lots of exercise. They usually accommodate several dogs. Licences give a maximum number of dogs allowed, but there can be more than ten dogs all mixing together. There’s often a range of sizes, ages and personalities in each group. So there should be at least one person in the area at all times, to break up any squabbles.
Dog daycare - What to look out for
Some dogs are fine in this mixed environment. For example, well-socialised adult dogs who enjoy interacting with other dogs, and are not overly physical in the way they play.

Other dogs may find this set up scary – usually it’s those who show fear or aggression around other dogs. And it can cause more social issues for them. You can do a trial day to see how your dog copes, but there are a few things to watch out for.

Most dogs behave well on a trial day. The presence of the other dogs often subdues any underlying aggression or anxiety. This can leave owners delighted their dog will overcome their social issues in this environment. But sadly, the long-term effect can be an increase in anxiety around dogs. This usually shows when they feel less threatened – often on walks with their owner.

Doggy daycare customers often say their dogs come home really tired and sleep almost straightaway. This may seem like a good thing, but it’s actually mental and physical exhaustion. Dogs need more sleep than us and should relax and sleep for several hours a day. At doggy daycare, dogs can spend most of their time interacting or playing with each other, and are alert most of their time there. This excessive play can make them obsessed with dogs on their walks. Some dogs can develop a habit of lunging and barking, especially when they’re on a lead and see another dog in the distance.

Well-trained dog daycare staff will be able to prevent your dog getting overstimulated, and reduce the chances of more social problems developing. So talk to them if you’re worried.
Check the carer’s licence and qualifications
The dog daycare industry is licenced through the local authority in a similar way to boarding kennels and home borders – they should display their certificate at the premises. If they don’t have one, they may be operating illegally. Licencing doesn’t call for qualifications in animal care, behaviour or training. Ask to see a copy of the carer’s licence certificate and find out about their qualifications before you book your dog in.          "
Services for your dog - dog walkers,"Dogs need a balanced diet, water and companionship in order to live happy and fulfilling lives, but on the top of their list is regular exercise. All dogs need exercise and this is usually in the form of a walk, but it’s not always possible for owners to take their dogs out. Whether it’s because of certain health issues impacting mobility or work commitments, some owners can’t always give their dog the exercise they need. That’s where dog walkers come in and there are plenty around!

But what should you look out for when choose a dog walker? Do they specialise in reactive or young dogs? Do they have any extra training? There are lots of things to consider when deciding whether you need an extra pair of hands.
Find the right walker for your dog
It’s quite important to remember that dog walkers are unregulated. Anyone can start a dog walking business and they don’t have to be licenced or have any professional training. It’s worth doing a bit of homework before you pick one. While many don’t have any qualifications, there are plenty who do and might specialise in an area your dog needs support in, like behaviour, training or first aid.
Finding your preference
It’s worth bearing in mind that many dog walkers take multiple dogs out at the same time – sometimes up to six! So you might want to consider whether this is right for your dog. Would you prefer them to have some one-on-one time with the dog walker? Some walkers offer individual walks where they can focus all their attention on your dog, and even train them.

Another thing to consider is your dog’s age. If they’re socially mature and confident around other dogs, it might not be an issue for you if your dog is walked with others. However, if they’re quite young, playful and not quite socialised, you might want to keep looking for the right dog walker.          "
Services for your dog - home boarding,"Home boarding is different from kennels, it offers your dog a more cosy, homely environment where they can enjoy some one-on-one time. And if you have a sociable dog who’s used to visiting different locations, dog home boarding could be a good option for your furry friend. Here are some things to consider before deciding whether to book your dog in for a holiday of their own.
Check their licence
Home boarding is regulated in a similar way as boarding kennels and doggy daycare. So if you’re considering a home boarder, ask to see their licence – they should display their certificate at the boarding premises. If they don’t have one, they may be operating illegally.
Ask about any qualifications
As with doggy daycare, boarding kennels and dog walkers, home boarders and their staff can run their business without needing qualifications in animal care, behaviour and training. So before you book your dog in, ask the home boarder what relevant training and qualifications the staff have.
Check where your dog will stay
Home boarding is more like normal home living than boarding kennels, and each home boarder has their own set up. So it’s best to check where your dog will be staying to make sure it suits them, and you’re happy for them to stay there.
Book a short stay for your dog first
When you think you’ve found the right home boarder, book your dog in for a day or two to make sure. When you know they’re happy and well looked after there, you can book them in for a longer stay whenever you need to.
Traditional boarding kennels and catteries
If you don’t fancy doggy daycare or home boarding as an option for your dog, you might want to try something more traditional. It’s worth trying a short stay at boarding kennels or a cattery so your pet can get used to the environment. The staff will also be able to give you feedback on how they behaved, if they ate, and other factors, during their stay.

There are specialist boarding facilities for small pet species too. Look for places that have appropriate vaccination, care, and cleaning protocols. Ensure the housing and any enclosures are suitably sized and appropriate for the time of year, especially during heatwaves or winter. To avoid any stress or fighting, the housing must keep them separate from other pets. Always pop along and visit before you book. You may not get to see the animals being boarded, but you should ask to see any vacant housing.

Though professional boarding establishments are regulated and the premises are inspected, it is still important to do your homework and ensure that you are comfortable with the individual caring for your precious pet.
Be prepared
When leaving your pet with a trusted individual, it’s important to give them instructions and information to help them give your pets the care you want them to receive. We recommend providing the following:

 	Veterinary contact info. Also, be sure to tell your vet who is caring for your pet in your absence.
 	If you have a dog, ensure the contact info of the person caring for them is added to their microchip and tag.
 	Feeding instructions – include what, when, and how your pet should be fed.
 	Include a description of their normal daily routines.
 	Housing needs for small pets and cats.
 	For cats, include litter tray instructions, and where best to place it.
 	Medication, including doses and times if required.
 	How to help them if they appear worried or frightened.
 	Likes and dislikes.
 	Exercise needs.

At-home day care
If you’re unsure about doggy daycare, kennels or home boarders, finding someone to take care of your dog at their home is a great option. You might know someone who loves dogs and is at home a lot, but is unable to have a dog. If they’re happy to help, they’ll be able to take care of your dog’s individual needs. This type of care is often the best option for young adult dogs and puppies.

The next best solution is a registered doggy day carer, or a registered home boarder that also does day care, in their own house. They may have a few dogs staying with them, but your dog will get a more individual approach to care. They’ll also have different spaces to relax, away from the other dogs, if they want to.

Do hamsters hibernate? And what is torpor?,"Despite many reports and articles out there claiming that hamsters go into hibernation over the winter months, pet hamsters should not hibernate. During the process of hibernation, an animal’s metabolism slows down to allow them to reduce the amount of energy they’re using. This causes them to enter a deep sleep for a long period of time. Our pet hamsters are not able to do this.

It can actually be very dangerous for hamsters to do this. When hamsters get too cold, they can go into a state called ‘torpor’. This puts them at serious risk of hypothermia and the result could be fatal.
What does torpor mean?
Torpor is the name of an involuntary state of reduced mental or motor activity. It’s a survival tactic which is automatically triggered when an animal gets too cold or if they have limited access to food and water. In torpor, the body temperature will lower along with the heart rate and metabolic rate for short periods of time.
Is my hamster in torpor?
There are some early signs of torpor to look out for. You might notice your hamster sleeping more than normal or being lethargic. You may even notice them shivering or shaking.

 	A hamster in a deep state of torpor will be limp and unresponsive to both touch and sound.
 	You may find them curled up into a ball as they will be trying to keep as warm as possible.
 	When you do touch them, they may feel cold to the touch.

Pick your hamster up and look carefully for any signs of breathing – you may only notice very slow, shallow breaths. When you stroke them, look out for some small movements in their whiskers.
What should I do if my hamster is in torpor?

 	If your hamster is in torpor, or you suspect they are, move them into a warm room.
 	Handle them very carefully and gently pick them up.
 	Lightly stroking and handling them may help them warm up and encourage them to gradually wake up.
 	Holding your hamster close to your body, or having skin-to-skin contact may also help to raise their body temperature.
 	You can also try warming them up carefully, by using a warm heat pad or warm water bottle wrapped in a towel – just make sure they’re not too hot.
 	Finally, take them to the vets as soon as possible.

How can I prevent my hamster going into torpor?

 	Hamsters go into this torpid state when exposed to cold temperatures. The best way to prevent this is to make sure the room they’re in is kept at around 18 – 21C all year round.
 	In the colder winter months, if their room cannot be kept at this temperature, move them into a warmer area of the house away from any draughts.
 	Provide your hamster with lots of bedding and soft paper/tissue bedding for nesting with – the more you can give them the better!
 	Check on your hamster regularly – this will help you to notice any changes quickly.

Ask the experts: caring for older cats and dogs," What steps can I take to prepare my pet for their senior years?
Preparation is key when it comes to caring for your senior pet, the earlier the better! We recommend switching your pet onto a senior diet at around six to seven years old. Pet food for senior cats and dogs tend to be lower in calories which is important for maintaining a healthy weight as their mobility decreases. It also includes all the nutrients an older pet needs.

To keep your furry friend nimble on their paws, it’s worth considering joint supplements, especially if you have larger breed that’s more likely to develop arthritis and mobility problems. We’d recommend starting them on supplements before you even notice signs of any stiffness or discomfort. Most importantly, regularly checking your pets will help you spot any problems early on. That way, any medical conditions can be treated a lot easier and it’ll be less expensive for you!
How can I health check my pet?
It’s a good idea to check over your pet from ‘nose to tail’ once a month.

 	Look inside their mouth to make sure their teeth are clean, their gums are pink and there’s no strong smell.
 	Their ears should be clean and free from wax.
 	Their nose shouldn’t be too runny and both eyes should be bright and free from cloudiness or gunk.
 	Gently feel over their body for any lumps and bumps.
 	Part their fur to check for fleas, sore skin, matted hair or debris like grass seeds.
 	Lift up their feet to check the length of their claws and the condition of their paw pads.
 	Keep an eye on their toileting habits in case of worms or digestive issues. Having regular ‘accidents’ indoors can also be a sign of illness.

It’s also worth noting that cats are prone to thyroid problems, so if you notice them eating and drinking more while losing weight, it’s best to speak with a vet as early as possible.
What changes can I make to my pet’s lifestyle as they get older?
You’ll notice your pet begin to take life slowly and you may find them sleeping more and taking less interest in play and exercise. Once you spot these signs, it’s best to reduce any vigorous activity like ball throwing for dogs. Even if your canine companion loves to chase still, it could be quite painful for them or cause some damage.

Check for any stiffness and set a timer for your dog on walks. For example, they might only be able to manage a comfortable 20 minute stroll rather than the usual one-hour ramble. At this time, start taking things slow, choose different routes and allow your dog to just sniff and potter around.

Don’t forget about enrichment! Just five minutes of mental stimulation a day can dramatically reduce doggy dementia! You can practice tricks they know (or even introduce some new ones), give them their meals using Kongs or puzzle feeders, or hide some treats in a snuffle mat for them to search out.
Should I be making any changes to my home?
You might want to consider a few interior changes to benefit your pet to prepare for reduced mobility that way it won’t come as much of a shock. A common problem we see in older pets is separation issues, when they can’t walk upstairs or get onto furniture any more, especially after spending their life sleeping comfortably in bed next to you or snuggled up on the sofa.

You should discourage jumping in dogs, especially as they get older, the hard impact can risk damaging their joints. Instead, you can use ramps or steps to help your pets get up and down from furniture, or in and out of the car. Remember, hard floors can be slippery and difficult to grip, so you might want to put more rugs or mats down for poorly paws.
Is it normal for my pet to have smelly breath?
Yes, but it shouldn’t be something you accept. While it’s very common for older pets to have smelly breath, it can be a sign of dental disease – usually brought on by a build-up of bacteria. Dental disease can cause pain, tooth decay, as well as other oral health problems and even heart disease. It’s well worth the time and effort to look after your pet’s teeth.

The best way is to brush your dog’s teeth regularly with pet-friendly toothpaste, alongside dental chews that are approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council. You can introduce your dog to a toothbrush by letting them lick off some yummy meaty toothpaste. Once they’re used to the brush, gradually move onto brushing. If your dog is already showing signs of dental disease, introducing a brush at this stage might irritate the gums further, so speak to your vet about having plaque and tartar removed.

For more information, see our article on How to look after your dog’s teeth.
How often should I take my pet to see a vet?
We recommend taking your pet to see the vet for a check-up at least once a year, as well as for any other symptoms or concerns. When you see your pet every day, you might not notice small changes, but your vet will be able to spot and monitor any issues. Some veterinary practices have senior pet clubs that include things like weight monitoring, blood tests, regular check-ups and discounts on medication too.

If your vet has prescribed your pet with any medication, speak to them about purchasing the prescription online, you’ll find it will be much cheaper! You can also chat to them about ongoing pain management for when you want to give your pet some relief just on the days they need it.

Separation anxiety in cats,"For particularly anxious cats, being separated from their owners can cause them a great deal of stress and as a result, they might start peeing around the house.

If they are feeling unsettled and want to feel closer to the owner and strengthen their bond, they may start to wee on items that smell strongly of their owner. This includes beds, sofas and worn clothing.
How to ease your cat’s anxiety

 	Clean the area they’re peeing on with a biological washing powder and water mix or a specific pet cleaning product. Avoid using any normal household detergents. These can have a strong smell and your cat may urinate over them to mask the odour.
 	Place something that has the cat’s scent on over the area or item that they’re urinating on. This could be a blanket or a bed that will help them feel their scent is already there.
 	Place a waterproof cover over the area or item and provide other places for the cat to leave their scent mark around the area. Including scratching posts, blankets, beds and litter trays. Cats are unlikely to pee on surfaces where the urine is likely to touch their paws.
 	Use plug ins such as Feliway and Pet Remedy to help relieve anxiety and promote a familiar environment. Please note, it’s not advised to use pet remedy for pregnant cats or young kittens.


What should you do if you’re going away?
If you’re worried about leaving your anxious cat to go on holiday, the best thing to is to leave items that smell strongly of you. If they’re staying at home, your scent will already be around the house, but leaving a worn item of clothing may help them to feel more settled. This can also be given to the cattery if you’ve booked them in for a stay.

Reducing anxiety in cats when you’re at home
More people are now working from home and while this is great for some pets, others may find they’re having no time to relax and have a quiet snooze.

Make sure your cat always has access to a quiet space where they can escape from people working or children playing. This will help them feel more settled in the home. It’s also a good idea to provide an easy route so your cat can go outside and access their food and litter trays. This will help to reduce any anxiety and stress.

Always keep an eye on your cat’s toilet habits and behaviour. If you notice any changes, contact your vet and seek their advice as soon as you can. In the meantime, if you have any more questions, or you still need advice about your cat, please don’t hesitate to contact us.          "
Cats and babies – everything you need to know in preparation,"Whether your cat has been in your life for several years, or you recently welcomed one into the home, it’s only fair they get treated as a member of the family. And out of respect, you should help them prepare for any changes in their life, especially if a human baby is about to be welcomed into the world. Here’s our advice on how to prepare, what to do when the baby is here and how to support your growing family.

Before the baby arrives
Before exposing your cat to change, preparation is key to help them adjust to new things. And we recommend starting as early as possible so it’s not as much of a shock when you bring home the baby.

 	If your cat has access to the room that will soon belong to the baby, make sure you start shutting it off before bringing the baby home.
 	Introduce your cat to any new baby items that you begin to collect in the home. Let them see and smell the items and rub against them to investigate. Allowing them to see the item first will reassure them there’s nothing to be worried about.
 	Start using any products such as baby lotions and powders on yourself. This will help your cat become more familiar with new smells that will fill the home.
 	Once your baby is born, bring a spare blanket home that smells of them, if possible. Place this somewhere your cat can go and investigate to get used to the baby’s scent.
 	Make sure your cat has plenty of private areas they can retreat to if they feel they want to be away from everything. High up spaces and hiding areas will help your cat to feel safe and enable them to escape.
 	Place the cat’s food, water, toys and litter trays in quiet areas away from where the baby is most likely to be.
 	Litter trays and feeding areas should remain separate in areas where your cat can visit without having to pass the baby if they don’t wish too.


Bringing home baby
Make sure all introductions are natural and relaxed for your cat. Allow them to come into the room with baby at their own pace as and when they feel ready. Many cats will stay away to begin with until they feel confident enough to come and investigate a little. Ensure any interactions between your cat and baby are supervised.

Interacting with your cat in the same way they are used to will help ease anxieties from them.

Don’t forget, your cat won’t know how busy you are with a little one and will still expect your affection, so continue to make time for your cat. If they’re used to wanting lots of attention and fuss from you, make sure they are still getting this. Setting some time aside dedicated to your feline friend will prevent them feeling frustrated. You are a vital resource for them.

Top tips for the future
Whether you have a baby or a house full of children already, if you’re thinking about getting a new cat, here are some tips on keeping everyone safe and happy.

 	Create a safe space for your furry new arrival. A dedicated room with all their belongings inside. It’s worth creating hiding places for your cat to retreat to where children aren’t allowed. For example, a cardboard box that they can hide in. If the cat is inside the box, then the children can’t touch.
 	Provide high up spaces where you cat can observe their surroundings out of reach of children.
 	Encourage positive interactions between your cat and the children. Allow the kids to sit down calmly and wait for the cat to come over for gentle fuss and attention. Get your children to hold a hand out for the cat to sniff but not touching them yet. It’s always best to allow the cat to instigate any attention rather than have children approaching them. This can cause your cat to feel worried and threatened, even if your child hasn’t meant to do this.
 	Some cats may take a while to warm up before allowing you to approach them, but sitting in the room and talking to them from a distance can help to build their confidence.
 	A great way for your children to safely interact with the cat from a distance is with toys. Feather wand toys create the perfect barrier for cats and children to interact. Many cats will love to chase the feathers and the rod will keep children at a safe distance to avoid accidental scratching.
 	Get your child involved with your cat’s feeding routine. Allow them to place the food down for the cat and leave them to come and eat. This will help your new cat acknowledge your children are providing something positive and tasty! This will help to build a strong bond for a happy future.

What to do when one guinea pig dies,"Unfortunately, the time may inevitably come when your guinea pig’s companion/s pass away and they are then living by themselves. At this time, you may have many questions about what you can do to keep your guinea pig content and happy, as well as having questions about why their behaviour may have changed.

&nbsp;
What should I do?
It’s important to monitor your guinea pig closely after they have lost a companion. Some guinea pigs can get depressed if they are left by themselves when their companion passes away and it could lead to them not eating and drinking. If this happens, they seem lethargic or they just don’t seem quite right, take them to your guinea pig friendly vet as soon as possible. Small pets like guinea pigs can go downhill very quickly if they stop eating and drinking, so it’s important to act straight away if you notice something is not right.

 
Will their behaviour change?
After losing a companion, you may notice that your guinea pig becomes much quieter than they were before, as well as a few other changes:

 	They will naturally become less vocal without a companion as they no longer have another guinea pig to talk to.
 	Your guinea pig may become a bit more reserved, less confident, more easily spooked or more nervous. As they are a prey species, they feel safer being with others of their own kind and living by themselves can be unsettling for them.
 	You may find that they are less active than normal, as they don’t have a companion to follow around and play with.

&nbsp;
What can I do to help my guinea pig?
The thing that will help your guinea pig the most will be to find a suitable guinea pig companion for them as and when you are ready. Unfortunately, human company cannot replace the 24/7 companionship that they get with another guinea pig. Contact a rescue centre like Woodgreen to see if they can help you find a suitable friend for your guinea pig.

In the meantime, you can also do the following:

 	Make sure your small pet has lots of hiding spaces around their enclosure. This will help them in feeling more safe and secure if they have a hiding space close by that they can retreat to if they get scared or spooked by something.
 	Ensure they have plenty of bedding to help keep them warm – in particular over the colder months.
 	Keep to their normal routine.
 	If possible, try to spend a bit more time with them like hand feeding and giving them extra fuss and attention.
 	Scatter their food around their enclosure or use puzzle feeders for their dried food rather than feeding them from a bowl. This will encourage them to move around and explore a bit more.
 	Add more toys and boredom breakers into their enclosure to keep them occupied.

Dog training methods explained,"The empathy we have for our four-legged family members should remain in the back of our minds when seeking professional help with their behaviour or training. It can be difficult to filter through all the industry jargon when searching for a dog trainer, walker or other dog professional – and that’s where we come in!

&nbsp;
Dog training with emotions in mind
At Woodgreen we want to build the best relationship with our pets. And we offer lots of services to help new and existing owners do the same.

With so much accessible information at your fingertips, it’s hard to navigate the good, bad and ultimately dangerous advice out there. It’s very simple to search for dog professionals on social media and see videos and photos of their work. Some of these businesses will claim to quickly ‘fix’ your dog’s behaviour problems, and their videos often look impressive. But there’s rarely a kind ‘quick fix’ for emotionally driven behaviour problems, such as barking at dogs, aggression and being destructive.

&nbsp;
Reinforcement vs punishment
Very simply, reinforcement increases the likelihood of a behaviour occurring again, while punishment reduces the likelihood of it occurring again.
What’s reinforcement?
If something your dog likes happens as a result of a behaviour, they’re likely to repeat it.

For example, if your dog picks up a shoe and you then chase them around to get it back, this is a fun game! On the other side, if you give your dog a small treat each time they sit, you’ll find they’re more likely to sit when asked.
What’s punishment?
Punishment is when something unpleasant happens as a result of a behaviour. While this method can help to reduce the behaviour, it generally doesn’t work forever, so you have to keep doing it.

Punishment doesn’t help a dog learn an acceptable alternative behaviour, either. So, if you knee your dog in the chest each time they jump up at you in greeting, they may eventually stop doing it if you hurt them sufficiently. But they haven’t learned how you’d like them to greet you.

A kinder alternative is to work on training a strong sit, only giving your dog attention when he’s sitting. This results in a dog who isn’t afraid you’ll hurt him, a behaviour that’s long-lasting that you can reinforce with your attention, and you can enjoy seeing your dog happy that you’ve returned home!

&nbsp;
Force-free and fear-free training
Reward-based methods don’t intimidate a dog in any way. These dog trainers practise positive reinforcement (adding something your pet likes to increase the behaviour) to train and modify behaviour.
They’ll use:

 	Food
 	Treats
 	Toys
 	Affection
 	Favourite activities

They won’t use

 	Choke collars
 	Pull harnesses
 	Prong collars

They’ll have a good understanding of why a behaviour is happening and work on improving the mood and emotional state of your pet, rather than applying a ‘quick fix’. Neglecting to deal with underlying emotions can mean the behaviour will come back, or you may end up with a more serious issue in the future.

&nbsp;
What’s balanced training?
Dog trainers who tend to use a variety of methods. They’ll often use some sort of positive punishment (adding something your dog finds unpleasant to decrease the likelihood of a behaviour re-occurring), which is likely to be scary or painful, to stop or interrupt unwanted behaviour. They’ll then use food rewards to work on a preferred alternative behaviour.
Balanced trainers may use

 	Food
 	Toys
 	Praise
 	E-collars (delivers an electric shock to the dog's neck when a button is pressed)
 	Choke chains
 	Prong collars (have spikes in the inside that pinch or squeeze a dog's neck when pulled)
 	Spray or rattle bottles

Methods that claim to quickly stop a behaviour in its tracks need to be quite scary or unpleasant to the dog to work. They may look impressive and you may see quick improvements, but often the unwanted behaviour is just supressed. The underlying emotions are still present and haven’t been changed. This means the behaviour could come back, possibly worse than before.

&nbsp;
Dominance, alpha theory, rank reduction and pack theory
Dog trainers who use dominance, alpha theory, rank reduction and pack theory – or hold these outdated beliefs about dogs - haven’t learned anything new in the last few years. These theories have been widely debunked and aren’t backed up by modern science and ethical opinion. It’s more likely that feral dogs live as a loosely-associated family group, and this is how we should consider a pet – as a member of our family. They need guidance and boundaries, but this doesn’t mean we should bully or scare them.

&nbsp;
Choosing a dog trainer 
When selecting someone to help with your dog’s training or behaviour, you should assess whether their methods are ethical and kind, not just effective or convenient. Training is a huge part of dog ownership and enjoying fun activities with our pets really helps to build a trusting and strong relationship.

Numerous studies have shown that using aversive training methods has a negative effect on a dog’s behaviour and well-being.

So, it’s important to think carefully about how you want to teach your companion.

Woodgreen offers training classes, behavioural support and educational workshops. Our behaviour specialists have many years’ experience, and are affiliated with organisations whose members are committed to using kind, effective and modern training methods.

Dog walking tips when out and about,"We’ve compiled these top tips to ensure your next ramble, stroll or saunter is enjoyable and relaxing, whether you’re a solo dog walker, couple or family.

&nbsp;
Don’t let your dog approach dogs on leads
Other dogs you encounter may be on a lead because they’re elderly, anxious, recovering from illness, don’t have a very good recall or another reason entirely. So, it’s important your own four-legged friend doesn’t run up to dogs who are on a lead.

Good etiquette is to pop your companion on the lead and allow the other dog and owner to pass by. You can then continue the walk, letting your dog off the lead again once your fellow walkers are some distance away.

&nbsp;
Ensure your dog’s basic training is up to scratch 
If you’re going to give your dog a taste of freedom during their walk, you need to be confident they’ll respond to you – even from a distance! A reliable recall is a must, especially around distractions, including children and other dogs. A solid 'leave' cue is also useful, as rubbish, faeces and discarded food can be potentially dangerous if eaten.

Check out our basic training tutorial videos

&nbsp;
Make sure you dog doesn’t jump up at people and children
Some dogs are social butterflies and want to greet people they meet! But not everyone’s comfortable around animals they don’t know – which is why your dog shouldn’t just go up to people, especially when children are present.

It’s also an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act for a dog to be ‘out of control’ in a public place. So, if someone you meet feels a bit uneasy that your dog will bite them, you’re actually causing an offence under this law. This includes dogs who might chase joggers or cyclists.

&nbsp;
Use an extendable lead sparingly
Keep your dog on a short length when near roads and in built-up areas. Otherwise, you’ll have less or no control if your dog’s way out in front and suddenly runs out into the road, or into someone’s garden. A long line is a good alternative if using an extendable lead encourages your dog to pull.

&nbsp;
Pick up your dog’s poo
It’s not a pleasant job but someone’s got to do it! Pick up after your dog, each and every time. If country walks are a regular pastime, why not consider investing in a pouch that’s designed for carrying full poo bags? As well as looking stylish, it’ll also mean you don’t get caught out in areas where bins are in short supply. And remember, leaving a full poo bag hanging in a tree is a big no-no!

&nbsp;
Be mindful of livestock
Keep your dog on lead in areas where there could be livestock. Farm animals who become stressed could abort their young, or even defend themselves and injure you or your dog. Farmers are also allowed to act to prevent dogs worrying their livestock, so keeping your dog on their lead is the best way to ensure everyone’s safe.

&nbsp;
Keep your eyes off your mobile phone
Pop your phone in your pocket or a bag and experience for yourself all the wonderful sights, smells and sounds your dog enjoys on their walk. Use this time to do a spot of training, interact with your dog in a fun way or just enjoy being together in the moment.

&nbsp;
Allow your dog to sniff
If you take toys and games out with you, factor in time for your dog to sniff and experience their environment. Playing with a ball is a quick way to tire out your dog physically, but it doesn’t exercise their brain. A good balance of different walking activities will keep your canine pal on their paws!

The amazing benefits of scent work for dogs,"It’s a well-known fact that dogs have an incredible sense of smell – far more superior than humans and many other mammals. In fact, it’s 40 times more sensitive than that of humans, and it’s been put to great use. From assisting the police and military with sniffing out bombs and drugs to providing invaluable support to people with disabilities, and detecting diseases.

&nbsp;
How scent work training can help you and your dog
We approach scent work with our dogs in a way that builds their confidence and emotional welfare, while strengthening their bond with humans. And you can do the same with your canine companion!

Scent work training is incredibly fun for dogs and their owners. You’ll love seeing your four-legged friend engaged in an activity that brings them joy. And you may even develop a new appreciation for this super skill – one that can sometimes create a lot of friction in your relationship. Think about those times you’ve called your dog and they didn’t come back because of a smell that’s caught their interest! Scent work training can do wonders for behavioural difficulties including recall, reactivity (lunging and growling), prey drive issues and anxiety. What’s not to love about it?

&nbsp;
Getting started
A big part of scent work training is the “find-it” activity, so it’s good to know about this before you start. Watch our video with Woodgreen behavioural and training specialist Lindsay

&nbsp;
Hide something they love
Next, hide your dog’s favourite toy or treats somewhere specific. But first, make sure the area is safe and doesn’t have any objects that could potentially injure them (wires, sharp objects, electrics or things that could fall on top of your dog). You can also make the area more interesting by using cardboard boxes, bags and pots etc. Get creative with hiding spots, but initially start off easy. If possible, ask someone to keep your dog under control while they watch you hide the toy/treats. Try and keep it fun and engaging – and get your dog enthused in whatever way works for them!

&nbsp;
Now it’s time to “find it”!
Once you have positioned the toy/treats, you can release your dog and ask them to “find-it”. Keep moving around to encourage your dog to continue searching. Praise them as they search and make a big fuss when they find the item/s. If they look at you for some help, encourage them to “find-it” while guiding them with your hands and tapping on items to search. Do this one to three times, but not too much as we don’t want them to lose interest!

&nbsp;
Out and about
If you consistently pair this fun activity with the word “find-it”, you can also use this cue out and about when you want to distract your dog from wildlife or other things that catch their eye – great for improving their recall! Take some tasty treats with you or their favourite toy and hide it in interesting places such as the long grass or different surfaces, such as tree trunks or benches.

And there you have it – the basics of scent work training. Don’t forget that the most important ingredient during this activity is FUN!

Bird flu – all you need to know,"There is a constant risk of bird flu spread by wild birds in the UK. Although the mandatory housing order was removed 18 April 23, the whole of the UK is still in an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ).

Bird flu is a fatal viral disease that can affect both wild and domestic birds, including chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. Cases usually peak in winter due to the migration of wild birds into the UK, who can bring the virus with them. It’s spread by:

 	Mixing with infected wild birds
 	Being exposed to faeces and feathers from infected birds
 	The virus being brought into your bird’s environment, for example from dirty footwear or clothing

&nbsp;
What are the signs of bird flu?
There are many different signs your poultry may display, including (but not limited to):

 	Loss of appetite
 	Lethargy
 	Coughing
 	Sneezing

Here’s the full list of signs and how to report bird flu. If you suspect any of your birds have the disease, it’s a legal requirement to report it straight away.

Waterfowl, such as ducks and geese, won’t always show signs of bird flu, so you should try to keep them separate from your other birds.


What do I need to do to protect my birds?
There’s currently a UK-wide Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) in force, meaning people who keep birds must, by law, follow strict biosecurity rules to prevent the spread of the virus.

DEFRA may also declare a Restricted or Surveillance Zone or a Captive Bird (Monitoring) Controlled Zone. Check out DEFRA’s website to find out what zone you are in and what guidelines you must follow.

Here are some simple measures you can take to protect your birds against bird flu:

 	Place food and water under cover to prevent contamination from wild birds
 	Change or disinfect your footwear when entering the enclosure to prevent any contamination
 	Remember to wash your hands before and after tending to your birds
 	Regularly clean and disinfect equipment and hard surfaces
 	Ensure you have proper rodent/vermin control in place
 	You can make your premises unattractive to wild birds by using scarecrows, foils or streamers
 	Prevent your birds from having access to neighbouring poultry
 	Reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry are kept

&nbsp;
I only have a small flock - do the restrictions still apply to me?
Yes! Since October 2022, around one in five bird flu cases were from poultry kept as pets in a garden.

It’s a legal requirement to practise good biosecurity and follow the mandatory housing measures to help prevent the spread of bird flu.

&nbsp;
Where can I find the most up to date advice?

 	Latest news from the UK government
 	Advice on how to prevent and stop it spreading
 	Guidance on how to house your birds safely
 	Sign up to receive bird flu alerts from the Animal and Plant Health Agency
 	An interactive avian influenza disease map, where you can check if there are any local restrictions in your area

&nbsp;
How can I stop my birds from getting bored?
When restrictions are in place, your birds will unlikely be able to enjoy free-range time in your garden. However, there are a number of things you can do so your flock doesn’t get bored:

 	Look at extending your birds’ enclosure to provide them with a larger space to enjoy during these periods.
 	Provide wooden perches and/or repurpose old furniture, such as chairs and tables, for them to jump and sit on. Large boxes and carriers are brilliant for them to nest in or sit on top of.
 	Add dust baths filled with organic compost or sand (this must come from a sealed bag and not from your garden).
 	Try hanging up a range of tasty treats, such as cabbages, carrots or corn on the cob. If you’ve got a selection of old CDs or DVDs you no longer use, you can also hang these up – your chickens will love looking at them!
 	Include feed balls, filled with a tasty treat like corn, for them to move around their enclosure.

What to do when one rabbit dies,"As rabbits are a prey species (animals that are food to other animals), they depend on companionship for security and comfort. But the day will inevitably come when one rabbit dies and your remaining pet is suddenly alone.

Take a look at our advice on how your existing rabbit’s behaviour could change and what you can do to help them, if you ever find yourself in this situation.

&nbsp;
Do rabbits know when another rabbit has died?
No research has been carried out, so it’s uncertain whether rabbits know when a companion has died. There are often changes in behaviour, but this could be due to them suddenly adjusting to living alone.

It’s important to monitor your rabbit closely after they’ve lost a companion. Some rabbits can become depressed if they’re left alone when a friend passes away. Your remaining pet may also stop eating and drinking. If this happens, or you think your pet seems lethargic or just not their usual self, take them to a rabbit-friendly vet as soon as possible. Small pets, such as rabbits, can go downhill very quickly, so make sure to act straight away if you notice something isn’t right.

&nbsp;
How will their behaviour change?
You may notice your rabbit becoming more withdrawn after losing their companion, compared to how they behaved previously. Signs to look out for include:

 	They’re a bit more reserved, less confident, easily spooked or nervous. As they’re a prey species, rabbits feel safer being with their own kind. Living by themselves can make them feel vulnerable.
 	Alternatively, your rabbit may want to interact with you more often, coming over to you for extra fuss and attention. This is because they’re missing that constant companionship.
 	They’re less active than normal – or not as willing to explore – as they don’t have a companion to follow around and play with.

&nbsp;
What can I do to help my rabbit?
The best way to support your rabbit is to get them a suitable companion, when you’re ready to take that step. Unfortunately, human company can’t replace the 24/7 companionship they’ll get with another of their species – so finding them a rabbit friend is a high priority!

The best pairing is a neutered male and neutered female. Contact a rescue centre like Woodgreen to ask for help with finding a friend for your lone rabbit. We also offer a mixing service, where your small pet will be mixed with another rabbit on neutral territory, under the watchful eyes of our expert team.

Looking to do the rabbit meet and greet yourself? We’ve got tons of handy information on how to introduce them to each other and tips on bonding, to help get you started. You can also reach out to us for more support.

&nbsp;
Tips to help a lone rabbit feel safe and secure
Until you’re able to find a companion for your rabbit, you can also try the following:

 	Place lots of hiding spaces around their enclosure and throughout the run. Your rabbit will feel more safe and secure to have a space they can retreat to if they get scared or spooked.
 	Provide extra bedding to help keep them warm, particularly during colder months. Add extra hay into their hutch or shed area, and into any hiding spaces.
 	If possible, try to keep to your rabbit’s normal routine. Spend a bit more time with them, such as sitting in their enclosure and hand-feeding them.
 	Scatter their food around the enclosure, place dried food into a food ball, or use a puzzle feeder. This will encourage your rabbit to move around, explore and give them something exciting to do.
 	Add more toys and other things to interact with in their enclosure to keep them occupied. We’ve also got lots of ideas on how you can make your rabbit feel at home.

Saying goodbye to a beloved pet is a difficult and often traumatic experience. But, remember, you’re not alone. If you’re grieving for a pet or facing the loss of a companion, get in touch with the Pet Bereavement Support Service at the Blue Cross.          "
Pregnant rabbits - what you need to do,"Do rabbits get pregnant every time they mate?
As with most species, female rabbits can get pregnant easily – it only takes the once! To prevent any unwanted pregnancies or accidental litters, it’s important to get both rabbits neutered if they’re living together, or if you’re planning to try and bond them. Otherwise, you could wake up one morning to an unexpected litter of baby rabbits!

Castrated males can stay fertile for another six weeks after their operation. So, introducing a neutered male to an unneutered female too soon can still lead to pregnancy. Take advice from your vet on how long to wait before trying to reintroduce them after their operations.

And remember, female rabbits can get pregnant almost straight away after giving birth. For more advice on this, see the section below, ‘How can I prevent my rabbit having more litters of babies?’ What age can rabbits breed?
Rabbits are able to breed from a young age. Males should be neutered by a vet when they’re around three to four months old, when their testicles have descended, and shouldn’t be living with an unneutered female after this. Females can be neutered from four to six months, depending on their size and weight.

&nbsp;
How long are rabbits pregnant for?
The average gestation period for rabbits, regardless of their breed, is around a month or 31 days, give or take a few days either side.

&nbsp;
How can I tell if my rabbit is pregnant?
With most rabbits, you can’t tell if they’re pregnant just by looking at them. Many won’t have the large, pregnant belly you’ll usually see in other species. Most people are often unaware their rabbit is pregnant until they find a litter of kittens (baby rabbits).

But you may notice your rabbit is acting strangely in the days leading up to the birth as they prepare to nest. Signs of nesting include:

 	Your rabbit going around collecting bunches of hay in her mouth, which she’ll then use to start building a nest.
 	Plucking her own fur to line the nest in order to keep the kits warm once they’re born.

Sometimes unneutered female rabbits can also display this nesting behaviour, even if they’re not pregnant (also known as a false pregnancy).

If she’s not given birth after around a month or so – and you’re certain she’s not been near another rabbit in the last five weeks – speak to your rabbit-friendly vet about getting her neutered as soon as possible.

&nbsp;
How many babies can rabbits have?
Rabbits commonly have around six kittens per litter, but some can have much larger or smaller litters. As females can get pregnant again within 24 hours of giving birth, it’s important to move any male rabbits immediately – otherwise, you could find that two rabbits quickly become double figures in a short period of time!

&nbsp;
How will I know when my rabbit is in labour?
Your female rabbit’s behaviour may change leading up to the birth, when she begins nesting, and for a few weeks afterwards. She could become more territorial and temperamental than usual.

Being a prey species, most rabbits will give birth when it’s quiet, usually in the early hours of the morning, when they feel safest and less threatened. Mum will give birth to her litter quite quickly, so you’ll likely notice the whole litter when you come across them for the first time in the nest.

&nbsp;
What do I need to do if I find my rabbit has given birth?
The best thing you can do is to leave the new mum to do her job!

Baby rabbits are born blind and deaf and will only have a very fine amount of hair on them for the first few days. As soon as they’re born their mum will keep her distance, only visiting to feed them a few times a day and night for very short periods.

This is often mistaken as the mum abandoning her babies. But it’s perfectly normal and is her way of keeping them safe from potential predators by not drawing much attention to the nesting area. Give her plenty of space to move away from the nest. If she’s mostly in a hutch or an indoor cage, a run or secure pen should be attached with some toys and hiding places inside, so she feels settled.

Make sure to add plenty of extra hay and freshly-picked grass into her enclosure, as she’ll likely be hungry!

The mum’s milk might not come in for several hours after giving birth – so don’t worry if it feels like she has no milk in her mammaries (teats). The easiest thing is to carry out a daily observation of her size and activity. If you need to check the nest, use a stick that’s been rubbed in the bedding from within the enclosure to gently part the nest and ensure the babies are well.

When you look in on the kittens for the first time, avoid touching them unless absolutely necessary. The babies should be completely dry and clean – and their mum clean, too. If you notice any discharge or blood and you suspect the birth happened at least an hour ago, you’ll need to seek veterinary advice. If you have to transport the babies for some reason, ideally scoop the whole nest into a carrier so that you don’t disturb the shape and smell.

Babies found outside the nest when they still have their eyes and ears closed are likely to have a medical issue. Alternatively, the mum could feel threatened so she’s chosen to pull the babies out of the nest for predators to take. While this can be very upsetting to see and attempts can be made to hand rear, most unfortunately don’t survive.

Inbred rabbits and those under stress may deliver stillborn babies, or may even attempt to kill them.

Finally, for reasons already mentioned earlier, it’s extremely important that entire male rabbits (males that haven’t been neutered) are removed as soon as an unexpected litter is discovered.

&nbsp;
Feeding the rabbits
The kittens will start to appear out of the nest at around three weeks old. They’ll have been practising eating hay from around two weeks, though. Once out, you can provide them with junior nuggets, as these are smaller and easier for them to manage.

Make sure to introduce any fresh forage and veg slowly, as too much too quickly will result in bloat or other stomach complaints, which can prove fatal. The best way to do this is to sprinkle freshly-picked grass among lots of hay.

When they’re around five to six weeks old, they’ll generally be fine with a good mix of fresh daily greens.

By around eight weeks old, they should be fully weaned and can be separated from their mum.

Offer water in a shallow bowl for them to drink from. Make sure the water is changed a couple of times a day and that the bowl is cleaned regularly, to reduce any risk of disease.

&nbsp;
When do the young male and female rabbits need separating?
If you get young rabbits neutered at the right time, you won’t need to separate the males and females! Take a look at the section below to find out when.

A whole litter of young rabbits may only be able to live together as a group for a few months. This is because, depending on the space you have available, they could start to fight as they reach maturity. So, it’s important you’re prepared with additional accommodation. If you notice any signs of fighting, you’ll need to split the litter, ideally into mixed sexed pairs or groups. Keep a close eye on them to make sure the pairs or groups you’ve chosen are getting along well.

&nbsp;
When should the young rabbits be neutered?
Neutering the youngsters not only helps avoid more unexpected litters, it can also prevent life-threatening health issues, and lets your rabbits live a fulfilled life with a companion. It also makes it easier to house or rehome your rabbits.

Young rabbits need to be fully weaned, separated from their mum, and be old enough for neutering. For males, this is when they’re around three to four months old, or as soon as their testicles have descended. It’s important that a male isn’t living with his mum, or any other unneutered adult female rabbit, after this point if he hasn’t yet been castrated.

Females can be neutered from four to six months depending on their size and weight. Talk to your rabbit-friendly vet who’ll be able to advise you on the right time to neuter. They may want to wait until your female rabbit is a little bit older and bigger before doing the operation. How can I prevent my rabbit having any more litters of babies?
If you find yourself with a surprise litter of baby rabbits, you need to act quickly because a female rabbit can get pregnant straight away after giving birth!

Immediately take out the male rabbit and house him somewhere completely separate. It’s possible the female is already pregnant again at this point, but it’s important to separate them anyway. Two rabbits can very quickly turn into over 20, so don’t take any chances!

You can take your male rabbit to the vet straight away to be castrated. Then, house him separately so he’s ready to mix back with your female once she’s neutered. You’ll need to wait a little while before neutering the female rabbit, though.

She can be neutered when her babies have been weaned, by eight weeks old. Once she’s neutered, let her recover from the operation, and then re-mix with the male rabbit.

Remember, the female rabbit is unlikely to accept another rabbit before being neutered. What’s more, reintroduction too soon before she’s neutered can lead to another pregnancy. Finding a home for baby rabbits
Lots of rabbits in the UK are currently looking for new homes, so you may find it’s a long wait for a rescue centre to take in your rabbits. You could choose to rehome your rabbits yourself; many rabbit rescue centres have plenty of resources available to help you on your way. Rabbit Rehome is a website where people and charities can advertise and search for available rabbits in the UK, as well as get advice on how to get started.

Often, rehoming in a neutered male and female paring gives the best chances of a life-long bond. But, this isn’t essential, so take a look at which rabbits spend the most time together to help you make your decision. It may take a while to rehome your rabbits, so be prepared to be patient.

All about Brucella canis infection in dogs,"Canine brucellosis is a disease in dogs caused by an infection with the bacteria, Brucella canis. It’s found across eastern Europe and parts of the USA and Asia. Although not an established disease in the UK, since 2020 it’s been diagnosed in dogs with links to travelling or visiting abroad.

&nbsp;
What is Brucella canis?
It’s usually a disease of the reproductive system, particularly causing problems with miscarrying litters. However, other parts of the body may also be affected causing fever, eye or kidney problems, or infection of the spine.

How does Brucella canis spread?

The Brucella canis bacteria spreads through infected fluids from the dogs’ reproductive tract, saliva, blood and urine.

After becoming infected, a dog can appear healthy but still carry and spread bacteria for a long period of time. Even with treatment, the infection may not be completely eliminated.

Brucella canis is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted from dogs to humans. Two people were diagnosed in 2022: one person in the Netherlands and the other in the UK. Both infections occurred after they handled dogs who were giving birth or had miscarried.

&nbsp;
Who’s at risk?
Dogs who’ve been imported into the UK, or travelled out and returned, may be infected with Brucella canis.

&nbsp;
What can be done?
If your dog’s been abroad and you’re looking to rehome them with Woodgreen, please ask your vet to test your pet for Brucella canis, before moving forward with your rehoming application. This helps reduce the risk to humans and other dogs. Take a look at our guidance for testing and results below.

If you’re unable to arrange a test, and you decide to continue with the rehoming application process, our Veterinary team will carry it out onsite at Woodgreen instead. Dogs who are positive for Brucella canis won’t be suitable for rehoming through Woodgreen, due to the public health risk they pose.

&nbsp;
Getting your dog tested
There are several tests available for Brucella canis that use a sample of your dog’s blood.  Accuracy varies, so we recommend one of the following:

 	Lateral flow test – This is quick and can be carried out at your vet clinic. A negative result in dogs with no signs of Brucellosis can usually be trusted, but a result is less reliable if your dog shows signs of the disease. The Bionote brand of lateral flow test is less likely to give a false positive than the brand. Any positive test should be followed up with a lab check to confirm the result.
 	Blood test sent to Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) for testing – This is carried out by APHA in its own lab, using two tests that will detect both recent and long-term infections. As these are performed by an external laboratory, results take a little longer but are more reliable.

If you’ve already had your dog checked using other available tests, please mention this when getting in touch with us, so that we can arrange for one of our Veterinary team to look at your pet’s medical history.

&nbsp;
Confirmed positive result – what does this mean for my dog?
Treatment is not recommended. A prolonged course of antibiotics often won’t clear the bacteria, meaning your dog remains infected. They will be infectious for life, even if they appear well, and potentially capable of passing the disease on through the contact of bodily fluids or in the air.

Neutering will reduce the risk of transmission but won’t eliminate it, and is risky for the vets and nurses involved. If your dog has a positive result as part of your application process with Woodgreen, please seek advice from your vet on how to manage the condition.

Spotting hay fever in dogs,"Always speak to a vet if your dog shows any of the symptoms mentioned in this article.

&nbsp;
What are the symptoms of hay fever in dogs?
The symptoms of hay fever, or other allergies, in dogs are similar to those we experience as humans. Although, canine companions (luckily!) tend to get them less often. One big difference is that a dog’s skin is more likely to be affected, especially their groin or abdomen.

You might notice:

 	scratching
 	nose rubbing
 	chewing paws
 	sneezing
 	lethargy (tiredness)
 	a runny nose
 	red or flaky skin

In dogs, hay fever and other allergies can look very similar. Your vet will be able to work out the cause of any symptoms.

&nbsp;
How to treat hay fever in dogs
It’s very important to speak to a vet about your dog’s symptoms. Never give antihistamines or other hay fever medications meant for humans to your dog as these can be very harmful, even toxic in some cases.
Your vet will be able to work out the cause of your dog’s symptoms, give an official diagnosis, and prescribe the right medication. Your best friend will be up to their old tricks again in no time!

After you’ve spoken to your vet, they might advise giving some of the treatments below:

 	a topical treatment such as a medicated shampoo or wipes
 	eye drops
 	a nasal spray
 	antihistamines for pets
 	an injection (in severe cases)

They may also advise you to add extra skin supplements to your dog’s diet during this time, such as omega 3 or 6.

&nbsp;
Secondary infections
In some cases, your dog may need treatment beyond hay fever medications. This is because, as your dog scratches, bites, and licks their skin, they risk opening it up to yeast and bacterial infections. All skin allergies in dogs come with a risk of these secondary infections.

&nbsp;
When does hay fever happen in dogs?
Just like in humans, hay fever in dogs is most likely to happen in spring, summer, and autumn when the trees and flowers bloom. Other allergies happen year-round. If your dog shows hay-fever-like symptoms at any time of year, they should be seen by a vet.

&nbsp;
What else could my dog be allergic to?
There are many other allergies which can mimic hay fever in dogs. For example, flea allergy dermatitis happens when a dog has an allergic reaction to flea bites. Or, they could be suffering from environmental allergies to mould. Your dogs can also have reactions to food intolerances and allergies, such as grains or certain animal proteins.

It might be that your dog’s symptoms aren’t related to an allergy, but something else. For example, we often associate sneezing with allergies, but sneezing in dogs can also be a sign that there’s something in their nasal passage that shouldn’t be there. Always speak to a vet who can diagnose and treat the problem.

&nbsp;
What you can do to help your dog in hay fever season
As well as speaking to your vet, there are a few other ways you can help your four-legged friend. As human hay fever sufferers know all too well, just because we’re inside, it doesn’t mean our symptoms disappear! Pollen can find its way onto us and into our homes without us realising.

With this in mind, you can help your dogs to feel more comfortable by minimising how much pollen they come into contact with.

Try these tips:

 	Wash your dog’s bedding regularly at 60 degrees Celsius
 	Wipe their coat and paws after they’ve been outside
 	Bathe and groom them regularly
 	Avoid walking in grassy areas and at times of the day when pollen exposure is high (often around midday).

Bathing and grooming your pup might feel daunting if you’re a new dog owner or you’re not used to doing it regularly. Luckily, we’ve got helpful advice in our articles on how to groom your dog and how to give your dog a bath. They’re awash with paw-some tips!

&nbsp;
Are some dog breeds more affected by hay fever than others?
There’s research that suggests some breeds such as Retrievers, Setters, and Bulldogs are more prone to developing hay fever. But the geographic region a dog’s in, along with exposure to local plants and lifestyle all play a role in this, too.

For example, in some areas or countries, there are specific allergens that are more likely to cause an allergic reaction than hay fever, such as insect allergens.

&nbsp;
Other ways to care for your dog in hot weather
Hay fever isn’t the only thing to think about as the weather starts to warm up. As much as we might enjoy basking in the sun, dogs can really struggle in the heat and need extra care.

From how to keep your home cool to spotting heatstroke in dogs, we’ve packed our hot-weather advice article full of top tips to keep your best friend safe, happy, and healthy. Quick FAQ
Remember: If you think your dog may have an allergy to pollen or anything else, always speak to a vet and don’t give your dog medication meant for humans.         "
Is your dog scared of loud noises? How to help,"Spotting sound sensitivities
Loud noises make us all jump from time to time, but a dog showing signs of fear will need your help to learn everything’s okay.

If your dog’s scared of loud noises, you might notice them doing any of the following:

 	Panting
 	Pacing
 	Trembling
 	Trying to hide
 	Clinging to you for comfort
 	Barking
 	Becoming distracted
 	Salivating
 	Not responding when you speak to them

There’s also a link between sound sensitivity and pain. So, if you notice your dog is stiff, becomes less playful, or is reluctant to jump up when it was easy before, then talk to your vet. In some cases, pain relief can help to lower sensitivity to sounds.

There’s also a link between sound sensitivity and pain. So, if you notice your dog is stiff, becomes less playful, or is reluctant to jump up when it was easy before, then talk to your vet. In some cases, pain relief can help to lower sensitivity to sounds. Extreme dog reactions
Some dogs have extreme reactions to loud sounds. This will look different in different dogs. For example, they might run away, hide, and not want to come back out, or they may bark and shake in a way that’s unusual for them.

If you think your dog is having an extreme reaction to loud sounds, you’ll need to ask your vet for advice. They might be able to prescribe some medication that could help your dog.

&nbsp;
What should you do?
Have you heard the old advice to “ignore your dog if they show fear”? Well, that won’t really help them. Your dog needs to learn that they’re safe and supported, and ignoring them doesn’t create the happy and calm state they need when they hear a scary sound.

However, we don’t recommend over-comforting a fearful dog, either. The best approach is to switch their focus to an enjoyable activity instead of drawing attention to the noise.

&nbsp;
How to help your dog feel less scared of loud noises
The earlier you start helping them, the more of a positive impact you’ll have on your dog’s wellbeing!

We recommend trying a desensitisation programme, which involves gradually getting your dogs used to loud noises. This should be done in a supportive and caring way. You can start by downloading some realistic sounds and playing them at a low volume during a training session or a game, or even while your dog is enjoying a tasty chew.

Over the course of a few sessions, gradually turn up the volume. But remember, moving too fast with this could make your dog extra aware of the sounds instead of teaching them to ignore them – the opposite of what you want!

If an unexpected noise happens, try throwing a treat or toy for your dog. This not only helps distract them, but creates a positive association; loud noises mean they get something nice!

To find out more about working on noise phobias with your dog, check out our handy loud noises video guide below.  At-home therapies
There are many non-prescription therapies and supplements available for dogs who are mildly or moderately stressed by certain sounds or experiences. Some have research behind them, but you should check with your vet first and read any research before you buy.

You’ll find there are lots of supplements available and we’ve listed a few below:

ADAPTIL plug ins or collars emit dog pheromones which give a feeling of safety and calm.

Yu-Calm L-Theanine has natural calming properties that support the production of calming compounds and hormones responsible for happiness such as serotonin and dopamine.

Pet Remedy is available in a plug-in diffuser and a spray to apply to bedding or a collar. It works by calming the brain and encouraging the pet to relax.

Anaxitane Chewable Tablets help pets keep calm and relaxed, containing a synthetic form of an amino acid usually found in green tea leaves.

Calmex is a blended supplement that has a calming effect.

&nbsp;
Is your dog scared of loud noises on walks?
If you’re on a walk and your dog shows some mild signs that they’re scared of loud noises, try treat sprinkling as soon as you can. Treat sprinkling is just as it sounds; you sprinkle tasty treats on the ground for your four-legged friend to enjoy!

It’s best to do this in the grass, so your dog can use their fantastic noses to sniff out and munch on the treats. You could also use toy play in this situation if that’s what your dog prefers.

If your dog starts showing any signs of severe stress, take them home as soon as you can and start a programme to get them used to loud noises (called a desensitisation programme). We’ve outlined what this could look like above, but our team is here if you need some extra help.

Remember: If your dog is a flight risk on a walk, meaning they might suddenly run away or bolt from their owner, then it’s important to keep them on a lead for their own safety.

You can find more advice and events on training on our dog advice pages.

&nbsp;
Puppies and loud noises
Puppies often don’t act scared the first or second time they hear loud noises such as fireworks, but if the owner does nothing, a fear can develop. This could be because their natural instincts start to kick in as they grow up and become more independent. They need to keep themselves safe without as much support from the adults who kept them out of harm’s way as a young puppy!

For more information about puppies, take a look at our advice on helping your puppy socialise and grow.

&nbsp;
Prepping for fireworks
The sound and sight of fireworks can be a very scary experience for dogs. Luckily, we can sometimes plan in advance to keep them feeling calm!

Here’s a summary of some things to think about before fireworks season:

 	Check your dog's microchip and tag details are up to date. Every year we see a big spike in stray dogs that come into our centre during fireworks season. The sooner an owner of a lost dog can be contacted, the better it is for pets and their people!
 	Make sure your garden is secure if you need to let your dog out after dark during fireworks season.
 	If you feel you have to walk your dog after dark, keep them on the lead and make sure they’re wearing a securely fitting harness.
 	If you know fireworks are going to happen on certain evenings, make sure your dog has been outside before dark, so they’ve been able to go to the toilet and have a walk. If they’re outside after dark, they’re likely to try and bolt.
