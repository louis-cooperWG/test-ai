So, it’s important your own four-legged friend doesn’t run up to dogs who are on a lead.</p><p>Good etiquette is to pop your companion on the lead and allow the other dog and owner to pass by. You can then continue the walk, letting your dog off the lead again once your fellow walkers are some distance away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Ensure your dog’s basic training is up to scratch </strong></h2><p>If you’re going to give your dog a taste of freedom during their walk, you need to be confident they’ll respond to you – even from a distance! A reliable <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/dog/how-to-improve-your-dogs-recall/">recall</a> is a must, especially around distractions, including children and other dogs. A solid ‘leave’ cue is also useful, as rubbish, faeces and discarded food can be potentially dangerous if eaten.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/dog/diy-dog-training/">basic training tutorial videos</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Make sure you dog doesn’t jump up at people and children</h2><p>Some dogs are social butterflies and want to greet people they meet! But not everyone’s comfortable around animals they don’t know – which is why your dog shouldn’t just go up to people, especially when children are present.</p><p>It’s also an offence under the Dangerous Dogs Act for a dog to be ‘out of control’ in a public place. So, if someone you meet feels a bit uneasy that your dog will bite them, you’re actually causing an offence under this law. This includes dogs who might chase joggers or cyclists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Use an extendable lead sparingly</h2><p>Keep your dog on a short length when near roads and in built-up areas. Otherwise, you’ll have less or no control if your dog’s way out in front and suddenly runs out into the road, or into someone’s garden. A long line is a good alternative if using an extendable lead encourages your dog to pull.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Pick up your dog’s poo</strong></h2><p>It’s not a pleasant job but someone’s got to do it! Pick up after your dog, each and every time. If country walks are a regular pastime, why not consider investing in a pouch that’s designed for carrying full poo bags? As well as looking stylish, it’ll also mean you don’t get caught out in areas where bins are in short supply. And remember, leaving a full poo bag hanging in a tree is a big no-no!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Be mindful of livestock</strong></h2><p>Keep your dog on lead in areas where there could be livestock. Farm animals who become stressed could abort their young, or even defend themselves and injure you or your dog. Farmers are also allowed to act to prevent dogs worrying their livestock, so keeping your dog on their lead is the best way to ensure everyone’s safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Keep your eyes off your mobile phone</strong></h2><p>Pop your phone in your pocket or a bag and experience for yourself all the wonderful sights, smells and sounds your dog enjoys on their walk. Use this time to do a spot of training, interact with your dog in a fun way or just enjoy being together in the moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Allow your dog to sniff</strong></h2><p>If you take toys and games out with you, factor in time for your dog to sniff and experience their environment. Playing with a ball is a quick way to tire out your dog physically, but it doesn’t exercise their brain. A good balance of different walking activities will keep your canine pal on their paws! <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/dog/the-right-exercise-for-your-dog/">Check out our videos on various exercise types</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Still looking for advice?</h2><p>Hopefully these tips will help you and your dog get the most out of your walks together.
