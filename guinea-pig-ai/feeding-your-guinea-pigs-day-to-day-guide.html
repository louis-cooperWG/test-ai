In the wild, they would live in dense foliage and spend their days grazing, so a healthy daily diet should include the following:</p><h3><strong>Hay</strong></h3><p>Hay makes up 85% of a guinea pig’s diet. Your small furry friends need constant access to hay or grass. They’re on their feet all day and constantly eating. In fact, your guinea pigs should be eating a pile of hay the same size as themselves every day.</p><p>It’s also great for helping to keep their teeth healthy! Spread the hay around their whole enclosure, run space and under hiding spaces. Offer a mixture of varieties such as:</p><ul><li>Baled mixed meadow hay.</li><li>Forage treat hay by Burgess.</li><li>Small amounts of Timothy Hay or Readigrass.</li></ul><p><strong>Avoid short, brown or yellow, dusty-smelling hay as it lacks in nutrition and may harm your guinea pigs.</strong></p><h3><strong>Pellets</strong></h3><p>5% of a guinea pig’s diet should be made up of good-quality pellets. They should be fed around an eggcup’s worth (20g) per day. Guinea pigs should not be fed muesli mixes as they are high in sugar and can lead to dental problems. Here at Woodgreen, we feed our guinea pigs on Burgess Excel pellets, which you can buy online or from most pet shops.</p><h3><strong>Safe plants and vegetables</strong></h3><p>The remaining 10% of their diet should be made up of plants and vegetables. This is about a handful per guinea, per day. Give them a variety of different fresh foods each day. You can also pick and grow your own foods to feed them – see our list of safe foods below.</p><h3>Water</h3><p>It’s vital that your guinea pigs have access to fresh water every day. Many guinea pigs prefer to drink from a bowl. Bottles are suitable but can often leak and be tricky to clean.</p><h2><strong><br> Foraging wild and garden plants for your guinea pigs</strong></h2><p>Foraging for your guinea pigs is a cost-effective and organic way of feeding them. Some forage, like stinging nettles and rose petals, can be dried out and given as treats later in the year. Other plants such as vegetables, or soft leaves like mallow can be fed on the day.</p><h3><strong>How to forage safely:</strong></h3><ul><li>Use suitable secateurs and garden gloves for prickly plants!</li><li>Take a plant ID or forage book with you so you don’t pick dangerous plants.</li><li>Don’t pick from areas close to the road or areas likely to have been toileted on by dogs and cats.</li><li>Only pick from gardens and areas you know are free from chemicals.</li><li>Introduce new foods slowly to avoid a bad reaction to the sudden change</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Garden plants and herbs for guinea pigs:</strong></h2><ul><li>Buddleia</li><li>Calendula</li><li>Hollyhocks (leaves)</li><li>Lavender</li><li>Nasturtium</li><li>Roses</li><li>Sunflowers</li><li>Wallflowers</li><li>Wild</li><li>Geranium</li><li>Basil</li><li>Bay borage</li><li>Catnip</li><li>Thyme</li><li>Chamomile</li><li>Chervil</li><li>Coriander</li><li>Dill</li><li>Fennel</li><li>Lemon balm</li><li>Lovage</li><li>Marjoram</li><li>Mint</li><li>Oregano</li><li>Parsley</li><li>Rosemary</li></ul><h3><strong>Twigs and shrubs </strong></h3><ul><li>Apple</li><li>Beech (not the nuts)</li><li>Blackthorn</li><li>Hawthorn (but remove the thorns)</li><li>Hazel (not the nuts)</li><li>Willow</li></ul><h3><strong>Vegetables</strong></h3><ul><li>Broccoli</li><li>Brussel sprouts</li><li>Cabbage</li><li>Carrot tops</li><li>Cauliflower</li><li>Celery</li><li>Courgette</li><li>Curly kale</li><li>Fennel</li><li>Peppers</li><li>Pumpkin</li><li>Radish tops</li><li>Rocket</li><li>Spinach</li><li>Spring greens</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>Squash</li><li>Watercress</li></ul><h3><strong>Fruit</strong></h3><ul><li>Crab apple</li><li>Pear</li><li>Tomato (in small pieces)</li></ul><h2><strong>Foods to avoid feeding to guinea pigs:</strong></h2><p>Dry mixes made with lots of colourings, dried fruits and cereals can have a negative effect on your guinea pigs’ health. If the mix is made with lots of dried soft fruit or peas your guinea pigs are likely to suffer with dental or urinary problems.</p><p>Colourful treats, sticky honey-based treats, salt licks and mineral blocks can all be harmful to your guinea pigs. If you’re feeding them a good quality natural diet, you won’t need any form of supplements.</p></div>
