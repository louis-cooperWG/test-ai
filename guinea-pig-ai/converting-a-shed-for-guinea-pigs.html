Before moving your pet guinea pigs into a new enclosure like a shed, there are a few essential home improvements to make sure they are kept safe.</p><p>First of all, you need to make sure the shed or Wendy house you want to convert is in good condition with no gaps, rotting or snapped wood. You might even need to consider moving the shed or Wendy house from its current position onto a hard-standing surface. This will make sure your guinea pigs can’t chew and burrow under, as well as protect them from predators who might be able to dig their way in.</p><h2>Installing locks</h2><p>If you haven’t got one already, it’s worth installing locks to further ensure your guinea pigs stay safe and secure. Here are some suitable options:</p><ul><li>Place two bolts on the outside – one at the top and one at that bottom. This will ensure that there is no danger of your guinea pigs being able to push out and escape.</li><li>Use sliding bolts on the outside of the door to keep it in place and secure.</li><li><strong>Swivel latches should not be used as children and predators can easily open these.</strong></li></ul><div id="attachment_6084" style="width: 383px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6084" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6084" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-600x600.jpg" alt="" width="373" height="373" srcset="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-600x600.jpg 600w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-800x800.jpg 800w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-150x150.jpg 150w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-768x768.jpg 768w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sliding-bolt-on-shed-door.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px"><p id="caption-attachment-6084" class="wp-caption-text">Sliding bolt &amp; padlock on shed door</p></div><h2><strong>Providing ventilation</strong></h2><p>Ventilation will ensure good air flow through the accommodation all year round. This is key to help prevent any respiratory illnesses. Wooden sheds retain heat so insuring good air flow will help keep your guinea pigs cool in the summer months.</p><div id="attachment_6085" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6085" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6085" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-600x600.jpg" alt="Ventilation on a shed for guinea pigs" width="374" height="374" srcset="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-600x600.jpg 600w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-800x800.jpg 800w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-150x150.jpg 150w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-768x768.jpg 768w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Window-ventilation-on-shed.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><p id="caption-attachment-6085" class="wp-caption-text">Window ventilation on a shed</p></div><p>Here are a few tips to help:</p><ul><li><strong>Windows</strong> should be replaced and covered with small gauge welded mesh attached to the inside of the frame. <strong>Chicken wire is not suitable</strong> – predators can easily get through it.</li><li><strong>Create a wooden</strong> <strong>framed inner mesh door</strong>, using small gauge welded mesh. This allows you to leave the main shed or Wendy house door open throughout the day during the summer, without risk of your pets getting out or predators getting in.</li><li><strong>Or, create a stable door with an inner mesh door</strong> – Cutting your main outside shed or Wendy house door through the middle will create a stable type door. That way you can keep the bottom half closed and insert an inner mesh door for the top part. You can then leave the top open all day without the risk your guinea pigs escaping or predators like cats and foxes getting in.</li></ul><div id="attachment_6086" style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6086" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6086" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-600x600.jpg" alt="Wendy house door on a shed for guinea pigs" width="372" height="372" srcset="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-600x600.jpg 600w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-800x800.jpg 800w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-150x150.jpg 150w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-768x768.jpg 768w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Wendy-house-door-guinea-pigs.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 372px) 100vw, 372px"><p id="caption-attachment-6086" class="wp-caption-text">Inner door on a guinea pig wendy house</p></div><h2><strong>Adding insulation</strong></h2><p>It’s worth lining the walls of your wooden shed or Wendy house to help keep your guinea pigs warm in the winter months. The best thing to do is use large sheets of wood or plywood with insulation in between. This will also prevent your pet guinea pigs from nibbling through the walls.</p><h2><strong>Stopping escapees!</strong></h2><p>Some pet guinea pigs like scurrying over to see their owners, especially when food is around. To prevent them from escaping when you want to go in to see them, there’s a simple solution. Just create a step over barrier by securing to the inside of the shed and their run across the bottom of the door frame. This gives you a golden opportunity to get in without your guinea pigs escaping.</p><h2><strong>Flooring</strong></h2><p>Lining the floor of the shed or Wendy house with lino will make cleaning an easier task. You’ll also increase the longevity as lino helps to prevent the floor rotting from urine.</p><h2><strong>Connecting a run and large enclosure</strong></h2><p>It’s worth connecting a secure run to your shed or Wendy house. This will help to keep your guinea pigs happy and secure while accessing two areas.</p><div id="attachment_6087" style="width: 383px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-6087" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-6087" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-600x600.jpg" alt="Connecting a run and large enclosure" width="373" height="373" srcset="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-600x600.jpg 600w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-800x800.jpg 800w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-150x150.jpg 150w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-768x768.jpg 768w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/RunAround-tubing-system.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px"><p id="caption-attachment-6087" class="wp-caption-text">Tunnel connecting wendy house and run</p></div><p>Here are a few tips on what you can do:</p><ul><li>Install a tubing or tunnel system. Visit <a href="https://www.runaround.co.uk/">RunAround</a> for inspiration.</li><li>Attach the run directly onto the shed using wood screws or place the accommodation within the run with a pop hole between the two. You can then close the hatch on this to prevent your guinea pigs accessing the run overnight and open it again in the morning. Make sure the pop hole is big enough for your guinea pigs to easily walk through.</li></ul><p>Read our article on <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/guinea-pig/how-to-house-your-guinea-pigs/">How to house your guinea pigs</a> and find out the ideal sized run for your pets.</p></div>
