<h1 class="c-hero__title">How to safely handle your guinea pigs</h1><p class="c-hero__subtitle h4">Guinea pigs can be fantastic pets for the whole family, and it’s important that everyone knows how to safely handle them. Here we look at how to keep your guinea pigs’ safe and happy when interacting with them.</p></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="1"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-bottom o-row--padding-top o-row--white c-text"><div class="o-container"><div class="o-wysiwyg o-article-width o-article-width--centered"><p>Most guinea pigs will try to wriggle free or run away when you want to pick them up – this is completely natural. Even though you can socialise with them, feed them from your hand and have them sit on your lap, they’ll always remain slightly wary of humans. You’re still a potential ‘predator’ in their eyes.</p><p>When choosing your guinea pigs, you might want to consider going for a pair of mature adults that are used to being handled. Babies and young guinea pigs can be extremely fast and easy to squeeze or drop, whereas a mature adult will sit happily on your lap munching some treats.</p><p>Allowing children to care for and bond with their pets can be an exciting and enjoyable experience. You should supervise them at all times to prevent the guinea pigs from being squeezed or dropped. Never allow a child to carry or walk around with your guinea pig in their arms. Instead, encourage them to sit on the floor with a blanket on their lap for the guinea pig to sit on. This way, if your guinea pig moves, there’s no risk of a fall injury.</p><p><strong>Watch our video below to find out the best way for children to interact with guinea pigs.</strong></p></div><div class="c-text__buttons o-article-width o-article-width--centered"></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="2"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-top o-row--padding-bottom o-row--white c-media"><div class="o-container arghhh"><div class="c-media__video-embed-wrapper"><div class="c-media__video-embed"> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Children and Guinea Pigs" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z91coLWc_ms?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwoodgreen.org.uk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-gtm-yt-inspected-9612800_294="true" id="376843925" data-gtm-yt-inspected-11="true"></iframe></div><div class="c-media__print-youtube-thumbnail"> <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z91coLWc_ms/mqdefault.jpg"></div></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="3"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-bottom o-row--padding-top o-row--white c-text"><div class="o-container"><div class="o-wysiwyg o-article-width o-article-width--centered"><h4><strong>On the move with your guinea pigs </strong></h4><p>It’s important that you always have a suitable pet carrier available, just in case you need to rush your guinea pigs to the vet. They’re also handy for when you’re cleaning out their enclosure. Cardboard boxes should be avoided as these can quickly and easily be nibbled through, leading to escapees.</p><p>Hard plastic cat carriers are perfect for your guinea pigs to use. To keep your guinea pigs relaxed and happy, place some newspaper or a fleecy blanket in the base of the carrier, along with lots of hay for them to eat and hide in.</p><h3 class="wysiwygStyledH4">Looking for more advice?</h3><p class="wysiwygStyledP">Whether you already have guinea pigs at home or thinking about getting some, our <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pet advice</a>&nbsp;will help you to keep your pets happy and healthy.
