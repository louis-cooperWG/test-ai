In fact, the risk of fungal and respiratory issues may be reduced as your guinea pigs will be in a dry, warm environment.</li><li>They’ll be safe from wild predators and bad weather.</li></ul><h3><strong>Cons:</strong></h3><ul><li>It may be tricky to dedicate an entire room for your guinea pigs that gives them the peace and quiet they need.</li><li>If you have cats or dogs, they might take a keen interest in your guinea pigs, causing your pets to become stressed.</li><li>They’ll have less opportunities to graze on grass. If they’re given time outside, they will need time to acclimatise to the temperatures.</li><li>You may be allergic to their bedding, which isn’t ideal.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Outdoor accommodation</strong></h2><h3><strong>Pros:</strong></h3><ul><li>They will enjoy living in a large, private area. Especially if you use a Wendy House or shed.</li><li>Provides a calmer and quiet area away from household noises and other pets such as dogs and cats. This will boost all your pets’ well-being.</li><li>It’s easier to allow them to graze throughout the year, as they will be more acclimatised to the weather.</li><li>It’s safer if anyone in your home suffers from allergies.</li></ul><h3><strong>Cons:</strong></h3><ul><li>You won’t be spending all day outdoors so less opportunity to socialise with your guinea pigs.</li><li>They’re more likely to have health issues that go unnoticed for longer periods.</li><li>They’ll be at risk of wild predators such as foxes, stoats and rats if their enclosure is not secure.</li><li>The weather can be an issue – there’s the risk of them becoming cold and damp during the winter and overheating during the summer.</li></ul></div><div class="c-text__buttons o-article-width o-article-width--centered"></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="2"></div><section class="o-row c-cta  o-row--padding-top o-row--padding-bottom o-row--white " ""=""><div class="o-container c-cta__container  "><div class="c-cta__media "><div class="c-cta__media-image"> <img class="c-cta__image" loading="lazy" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/guinea_pigs_e_learning-768x405.jpeg" srcset="

Indoor cages come in different sizes, but if you have a smaller one, it leaves little opportunity for you to be creative with their environment.</p><p>For inspiration, take a look at some <a href="https://candcguineapigcages.co.uk/">C&amp;C examples</a>. They have a range of affordable modular cages. They’re more suited to empty spaces in your home. But due to their open-top design, they’re not suited to homes with cats, dogs or young children.</p><h3><strong>Where to place your indoor cage</strong></h3><p>Guinea pigs are a prey species and are easily scared by loud noises. So avoid placing them in busy, noisy rooms like the living room, kitchen or a play room. Keep their enclosure away from any draughts throughout the year and hot sunny windows in the summer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How long do guinea pigs live indoors?</h2><p>Guinea pigs housed indoors don’t live any longer than outdoor guinea pigs. There are equal benefits of both accommodation preferences. As long as you’re meeting the five welfare needs for your piggies, they’ll live happy and healthy lives.</p><p>If you temporarily move your guinea pigs indoors during the winter months, you should keep them in until the weather is much warmer and the temperature outdoors is similar to that indoors. Otherwise they will struggle to adjust from the temperature difference of being in a heated home to the temperature outside during the cold months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Can guinea pigs live outdoors?</h2><p>Yes! Guinea pigs can be housed and live outdoors. This is probably in fact the best place for them to live as they can be acclimatised to the weather all year round.</p><p>There are many single-level hutches available in pet stores and online. But many are very poorly made and often fall apart within the first two years. So consider investing a little more, if you can, with a welfare-approved hutch company and get yourself a hutch which is made of strong wood. Your hutch should also have suitable bolts on the doors – cunning predators can easily open hutches with swivel latches.</p><p>Double-level hutches are not ideal for guinea pigs. Although some will use both levels, most only end up using one, as the ramps are usually quite steep and provide little grip, if any at all. They’re also at risk of falling down the ramp or floor hole when they’re elderly and less mobile. Chicken coops or plastic pods are also not suitable for guinea pigs. The housing area is often very small and can become damp and mouldy. It also offers limited space if the run area is too wet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>What can you do in winter?</h2><p>If you go with the hutch option, make sure you have a plan of action for when winter comes. Many hutches now come with ventilated covers, allowing the hutch to be outside all year round. The best protection will come from placing the hutch inside a shed or well-ventilated outbuilding with natural daylight. This will help to keep them warm and safe from predators.

To create a guinea pig shed, all you need to do is install a mesh door for ventilation and a step over barrier to stop any escapees. A shed offers more floor space for the guinea pigs, which means more room to explore! It also means you can socialise with your guinea pig, whatever the weather.</p><p>If you fancy a bit of a project, check out our article on <a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/pet-advice/guinea-pig/converting-a-shed-for-guinea-pigs/">converting a shed for guinea pigs</a>. Steer clear of plastic children’s play houses. These can get very hot in the summer months, so not a very suitable choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Outdoor run</h2><p>Guinea pigs are natural-born grazers! On sunny, dry days, they love spending time on the grass and need a minimum of four-six hours to graze. Alternatively, they should have access to a good mixture of safe garden plants. There are plenty of other benefits of the great outdoors. Guinea pigs are more likely to fight with their companions if they’re confined to a hutch for long periods of time. On top of that, there’s a greater risk of them suffering from health conditions due to a lack of Vitamin D.</p><p><strong>The garden run will need to be:</strong></p><ul><li>6ft x 4ft in size for 2-3 guinea pigs</li><li>wooden framed with a removable/hinged lid to allow easy access to the guinea pigs</li><li>well-built to prevent predators and young children trying to climb in when you’re not able to supervise</li></ul><p>Your guinea pigs will need multiple hiding areas/tunnels spread throughout their whole run – the more the better. They don’t feel safe grazing in open spaces – it’s a big, wide world out there for such small pets. So you’ll often find them hiding in one corner or under the only shelter available. It’s a good idea to provide multiple options for them to move between.

Metal runs often don’t have a secure lid, are flimsy against predators and weather, and guinea pigs can get trapped or injured due to the large mesh spacing. A-frames generally only have one door so rounding up the guinea pigs can be very tricky. And they’re rarely available in the required minimum size. It’s probably best to avoid them altogether!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>DIY dos and don’ts</strong></h2><p>Before you get started on your grand design, it’s vital you have the right materials. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Chicken wire is not suitable for animal housing</strong> – it’s too weak and easy for predators to break in to.</li><li><strong>Use small gauge, strong welded mesh</strong>. Nail or heavy-duty staple the mesh onto the inside of the run to prevent your guinea pigs from chewing the framework.</li><li><strong>Place secure bolts on doors of outdoor hutches, sheds and runs</strong> – predators and young children can easily open swivel latches or flimsy bolts.</li><li><strong>Run lids</strong> will need to be strong enough to withhold a predator or windblown items landing on them. Ideally, <strong>make it in three sections with a supporting beam </strong>to aid the strength and prevent dipping in the middle.</li><li><strong>Use suitable wood screws to secure the run panels together</strong> – cable ties are not suitable.</li></ul></div>
