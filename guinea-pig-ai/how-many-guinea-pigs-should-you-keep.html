<h1 class="c-hero__title">How many guinea pigs should you keep?</h1><p class="c-hero__subtitle h4">Guinea pigs are naturally sociable creatures that need companionship to stay happy. In the wild, they live together in large herds, so they should always be kept in pairs or small groups. Here we talk all about companionship and suitable combinations.</p></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="1"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-bottom o-row--no-padding-top o-row--white c-text"><div class="o-container"><div class="o-wysiwyg o-article-width o-article-width--centered"><p>When it comes to deciding whether to keep guinea pigs, you might have lots of questions on your lips including how many guinea pigs should I get? Just remember if you love guinea pigs and want to bring one home, you should get two or more to keep them happy and healthy. Here’s some information on how to help your guinea pigs become furever friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Suitable combinations</h2><ul><li>Two or more sows (female guinea pigs)</li><li>Two boars (male guinea pigs) – now this can be tricky! Mixing two single boars together can take multiple introductions to single males before a good match is found. If you have a pair under one year old, there is a risk that they may start to fight as they mature. This could lead to them needing to be separated.</li><li>A neutered boar with one or more sows.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Can three male guinea pigs live together?</strong></h2><p>You should think very carefully when it comes to housing three sibling boars together. Although they often start off living together well, one guinea pig is likely to be badly bullied. So there’s a high risk of them fighting and needing to be separated in the future.</p><p>The same goes for a boar with a young male under one year old. Although the mix may work at first, when the young male matures he will compete for dominancy, which could result in serious fights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Unsuitable combinations</strong></h2><p><strong>A rabbit and a guinea pig should not live together. </strong>Although some owners have found that a rabbit and guinea pig can live happily in each other’s company, there’s a risk that the guinea pig will be accidentally kicked when the rabbit is running and hopping about. Communication is a big factor to consider as well. Guinea pigs are vocal communicators, whereas rabbits are mostly silent, and this can be upsetting for both species.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to introduce your guinea pigs to each other</h2><p>If you find yourself with a single guinea pig, or you’d like to expand your herd, we can help! Woodgreen’s onsite mixing service is a lifeline for owners looking for support with finding their single guinea pigs a lasting companion. This could involve mixing onsite or providing you with advice on how to mix them at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Do guinea pigs need to be in pairs?</strong></h2><p>Guinea pigs thrive in the company of other guinea pigs and the best combination is a pair of guinea pigs, but they don’t necessarily need to be in pairs. If you have a group of three or more that live happily together, that’s great!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Preparing to mix guinea pigs</strong></h2><p>When introducing guinea pigs, it’s very important this is done on neutral ground. Start in the morning so you have the whole day to watch them closely. It’s best to mix them in the outside run where they have lots of space and grass. If you do mix indoors, make sure they have plenty of space.</p><h3><strong>Your mixing check-list:</strong></h3><ul><li>Clean the mixing area with pet-friendly disinfectant.</li><li>Add new/clean open-ended <a href="https://www.thehayexperts.co.uk/guinea-pig/tunnels-hides">tunnels and hides</a> (at least one per guinea pig, or more if you are able to add them in).</li><li>Scatter plenty of hay throughout the mixing area and under hiding spaces.</li><li>Scatter their pelleted food and/or any forage or veg.</li><li>Watch our video below for information on choosing the right companion for your guinea pig, how to mix them, and the behaviours to look out for.</li></ul></div><div class="c-text__buttons o-article-width o-article-width--centered"></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="2"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-top o-row--padding-bottom o-row--white c-media"><div class="o-container arghhh"><div class="c-media__video-embed-wrapper"><div class="c-media__video-embed"> <iframe loading="lazy" title="How to introduce guinea pigs to one another" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8h9IwsOqQAc?feature=oembed&amp;rel=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwoodgreen.org.uk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-gtm-yt-inspected-13="true" id="450669131" data-gtm-yt-inspected-9612800_294="true"></iframe></div><div class="c-media__print-youtube-thumbnail"> <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8h9IwsOqQAc/mqdefault.jpg"></div></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="3"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-bottom o-row--padding-top o-row--white c-text"><div class="o-container"><div class="o-wysiwyg o-article-width o-article-width--centered"><h2><strong>Starting the bonding process</strong></h2><p>Once your mixing area is up and running, your guinea pigs are ready to enter. Place them in at the same time and allow them to explore their new surroundings and approach each other in their own time. Guinea pigs will often show signs of bonding or aggression fairly quickly.</p><h3><strong>Signs your guinea pigs may accept each other</strong></h3><ul><li>Eating close to each other.</li><li>Grooming each other’s faces.</li><li>Happy gentle squeaks.</li><li>Calmly following each other.</li></ul><h3><strong>Signs your guinea pigs may not accept one another</strong></h3><ul><li>Rearing their heads up at each other with open mouths (Raising head over other guinea pigs to show dominance)</li><li>Chattering of teeth.</li><li>Regularly walking to the side with their rump in the air.</li><li>Fur standing on end.</li></ul><p>If you see the following during a mix or between an already bonded pair, you should separate the guinea pigs immediately.</p><ul><li>Attacking the face or rump.</li><li>Signs of injury/blood – call your guinea pig friendly vet so they can be checked over.</li></ul><p>Health check all guinea pigs daily to spot any hidden injuries. When mixing a group, make sure you watch them carefully to make sure there is no bullying.</p><p>If mixing is taking place indoors and everything is going well by the late afternoon/early evening, leave them in that space overnight.</p><p>If you choose to mix outdoors, make sure their main living space has been thoroughly cleaned. Then move their hiding spaces and hay from their mixing space into their normal living area – this will help the guinea pigs settle in the environment as it will smell like both of them. Keep a close eye on them to make sure they settle into the new space before leaving them overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Neutering: what you need to know</h2><p>Vets don’t typically agree to neutering female guinea pigs, unless it’s necessary to treat another illness. This is because it can come with many complications.</p><p>Males can be neutered if they will not pair with a male and need to be mixed with females.</p><p>Unlike other species, neutering a male guinea pig will not affect their behaviour, so it’s not a solution to a fighting pair of males. If you do have to get your guinea pigs neutered, choose a vet who specialises in small pets and has lots of experience in neutering guinea pigs to ensure a swift recovery.</p></div><div class="c-text__buttons o-article-width o-article-width--centered"></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="4"></div><section class="o-row c-cta  o-row--padding-top o-row--padding-bottom o-row--white " ""=""><div class="o-container c-cta__container  "><div class="c-cta__media "><div class="c-cta__media-image"> <img class="c-cta__image" loading="lazy" src="https://woodgreen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/guinea_pigs_e_learning-768x405.jpeg" srcset="
