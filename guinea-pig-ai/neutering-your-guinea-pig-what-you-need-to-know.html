Neutering female guinea pigs can be very risky and should only be taken on by a guinea pig savvy vet if it needs doing for emergency reasons.</p><p class="wysiwygStyledP">Unlike rabbits, neutering male guinea pigs doesn’t affect their behaviour and will not reduce fighting between a pair. Therefore, the general advice is to only neuter male guinea pigs if they cannot be paired with a male due to fighting, and need to be paired with a female.</p><p class="wysiwygStyledP">Male guinea pigs can be&nbsp;neutered&nbsp;from 3-4 months or as soon as their testicles are visible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="c-text__buttons o-article-width o-article-width--centered"></div></div></section><div class="offset-anchor" id="2"></div><section class="o-row o-row--padding-bottom o-row--padding-top o-row--white c-text"><div class="o-container"><div class="o-wysiwyg o-article-width o-article-width--centered"><h2 class="wysiwygStyledH4">Before and after care&nbsp;for your guinea pigs</h2><p class="wysiwygStyledP">Some small&nbsp;animal species&nbsp;need to be starved for a certain amount of time&nbsp;before an operation,&nbsp;guinea pigs should not be starved, and must have a constant access to fresh hay and water.</p><p class="wysiwygStyledP">Once&nbsp;your&nbsp;guinea pigs have returned from the vets, it is very important to monitor their castrate wound for swelling or signs of infection. You should also monitor their toileting output which should be of normal amounts – if this has reduced or the poo appears smaller, then it is important to take advice from your vets straight away.</p><p class="wysiwygStyledP">It is very important that a male is neutered and rested for up to three weeks before you pair with a female to prevent unwanted babies.</p><h2 class="wysiwygStyledH4">Looking for more advice?</h2><p class="wysiwygStyledP">If you are concerned about your&nbsp;guinea pigs’&nbsp;health, or have any other questions about your pet, please do not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-cke-saved-href="https://woodgreen.org.uk/contact-us">contact us</a>.</p></div>
