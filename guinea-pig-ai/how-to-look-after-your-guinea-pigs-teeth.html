Some guinea pigs can be more prone to dental problems than others.</p><p><strong>What should you feed them</strong></p><p>Feeding your guinea pigs the right diet is the best way of ensuring good dental health. Their diet should be made up of 85% hay. This should be a pile of hay the same size of them and they should eat this daily. Not only will this keep them in good health, it’s also great for helping to keep their teeth in good shape.</p><p>Guinea pigs should not be fed muesli mixes as they are high in sugar and can lead to dental problems. Instead, switch to feeding your guinea pigs an egg cup of pellets each per day. Providing them with fresh forage including apple and willow twigs, and giving them opportunities to graze on grass, will also help keep their teeth healthy.</p><p><strong>Checking your guinea pig’s teeth</strong></p><p>When giving your guinea pigs their weekly health check, take a good look at their front teeth or incisors. You’ll see two teeth at the top and two at the bottom – they should be white and smooth and clearly wearing against each other.</p><p>If your piggy is missing a tooth, notice that one or more are a lot longer, or they’re wearing down at an angle, contact your guinea pig friendly vet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
